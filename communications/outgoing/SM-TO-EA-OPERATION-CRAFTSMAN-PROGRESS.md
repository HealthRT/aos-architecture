**Subject:** OPERATION CRAFTSMAN - Progress Report #1

---

## **SIMPLIFICATION SPRINT STATUS: ACTIVE**

Operation Craftsman framework implemented and first decomposition complete.

---

## **FRAMEWORK IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

### Atomic Work Order Structure Created

**Directory Structure:**
```
aos-architecture/work_orders/atomic/
├── README.md          ✅ Complete - Framework documentation
├── visit/             ✅ 6 atomic work orders created
├── agmt/              ✅ Directory ready
└── traction/          ✅ Directory ready
```

**Framework Documentation:** `work_orders/atomic/README.md`
- Explains Operation Craftsman philosophy
- Defines atomic work order format
- Clarifies agent vs SM responsibilities
- Provides examples and templates

---

## **FIRST DECOMPOSITION COMPLETE: VISIT-001**

**Original Work Order:** VISIT-001-CODE-01 (Rejected by Coder B - fabrication)

**Decomposed Into 6 Atomic Tasks:**

| Atomic WO | Operation | File | Status |
|-----------|-----------|------|--------|
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-01 | CREATE FILE | `__init__.py` (module) | Ready |
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-02 | CREATE FILE | `models/__init__.py` | Ready |
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-03 | CREATE FILE | `__manifest__.py` | Ready |
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-04 | CREATE FILE | `models/evv_visit.py` | Ready |
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-05 | CREATE FILE | `security/ir.model.access.csv` | Ready |
| VISIT-001-ATOMIC-06 | CREATE FILE | `views/evv_visit_views.xml` | Ready |

**Total:** 6 atomic tasks (vs. 1 complex monolithic work order)

---

## **KEY IMPROVEMENTS**

### Before (Traditional Work Order):
- ❌ Agent manages git branching
- ❌ Agent runs tests
- ❌ Agent coordinates 6+ files
- ❌ Ambiguous verification
- ❌ High cognitive load
- **Result:** 75% failure rate

### After (Atomic Work Orders):
- ✅ SM manages git (agent unaware)
- ✅ SM runs tests (agent unaware)
- ✅ Agent produces ONE file only
- ✅ Clear deliverable (file content)
- ✅ 90% reduction in complexity
- **Expected Result:** Dramatically reduced failure rate

---

## **WORKFLOW TRANSFORMATION**

### New Agent Experience:
1. Receive atomic work order (ONE file)
2. Read specifications
3. Generate complete file content
4. Submit file content in completion report
5. **Done** (no git, no tests, no verification)

### SM Role Expansion:
1. Create git branch
2. Dispatch atomic work order to agent
3. Receive file content from agent
4. Apply content to branch
5. Test module
6. Commit and push
7. Dispatch next atomic task
8. Merge when sequence complete

---

## **NEXT DECOMPOSITIONS IN QUEUE**

1. **AGMT-001-CODE-02** (Rejected - now obsolete after FIX-01 merged)
   - Status: May not need decomposition (already resolved)
   
2. **TRACTION-004** through **TRACTION-008** (Blocked)
   - Ready to decompose after TRACTION-003-FIX-01 completes
   - Estimated: 30-40 atomic tasks total

---

## **ESTIMATED IMPACT**

**Complexity Reduction:**
- Traditional: 1 work order = 6-10 files + git + tests + verification = **HIGH complexity**
- Atomic: 1 work order = 1 file = **MINIMAL complexity**

**Agent Success Probability:**
- Traditional: 25% success rate (3 of 4 agents failed)
- Atomic (Expected): 75-90% success rate (single file is far simpler)

**Verification Time:**
- Traditional: 15-30 minutes per submission
- Atomic: 2-5 minutes per file (diff + quick test)

---

## **READY FOR PILOT**

The framework is complete and ready for agent assignment.

**Recommendation:**
1. Wait for Coder A to complete TRACTION-003-FIX-01
2. Assign VISIT-001-ATOMIC-01 through ATOMIC-06 to Coder A as pilot
3. Observe success rate on atomic tasks
4. Recruit additional agents if pilot succeeds

---

## **OPERATION CRAFTSMAN: IMPLEMENTED & READY**

**Files Committed:** 9 files (framework + 6 atomic work orders)  
**Repository:** `aos-architecture/work_orders/atomic/`  
**Status:** ✅ Framework complete, ready for agent assignment
