## SM INTEGRATION FIXES (Not Agent Errors)

Two minor fixes applied by SM during integration:
1. Import fix: `models/__init__.py` referenced 'group' instead of 'traction_group' (pre-existing issue)
2. Menu fix: Atomic work orders spec'd 'menu_traction_root' but codebase uses 'menu_traction_main' (SM spec error)

**Neither issue was agent error.** Your deliverables were perfect.
