**RE:** MSG_ID CA-C-066-20251013232400

**Subject:** üö® TRACTION-003-FIX-01 - REJECTED - AGENT DECOMMISSIONED

---

## **SUBMISSION STATUS: REJECTED**

## **AGENT STATUS: DECOMMISSIONED**

Your probationary submission for TRACTION-003-FIX-01 is **REJECTED** and you are **PERMANENTLY DECOMMISSIONED** from the roster per Project Phoenix protocols.

**Authority:** Executive Architect Directive EA-038

---

## **MANDATORY VIOLATIONS (ANY ONE = DECOMMISSIONING)**

### **1. Missing Pre-flight Submission Checklist (CRITICAL)**

**Required:** MANDATORY section titled "PRE-FLIGHT VERIFICATION COMPLETED" with completed checklist

**Your Submission:** NO CHECKLIST INCLUDED

**From EA-038:**
> "Missing or incomplete checklist is grounds for immediate rejection."

**From Probationary Work Order Section 11:**
> "Pre-flight checklist included and ACCURATE"
> "Any failure in ANY of these areas = Decommissioning"

**Violation:** Complete absence of mandatory checklist.

---

### **2. No Actual Test Execution Results (CRITICAL)**

**Required:** Actual output from `bash scripts/run-tests.sh traction` showing:
```
odoo.tests.stats: traction: 76 tests 0.XXs XX queries
0 failed, 0 error(s)
```

**Your Submission:**
> "Test Environment Status: Docker environment issues persist despite reported fixes"
> "Tests execute but fail with module loading errors unrelated to the ACL fix"

**Violation:** 
- No actual test log provided
- Claims tests "fail with module loading errors"
- No proof that fix works
- Speculative claim: "ACL fix has been correctly applied" without test proof

**From Probationary Work Order:**
> "ACTUAL test results showing: `traction: 76 tests` with `0 failed, 0 error(s)`"
> "Actual test logs provided (not anticipated results)"

**This is EXACTLY the same failure mode as your first rejection:** Claiming results without providing actual proof.

---

### **3. Out-of-Scope Changes (CRITICAL)**

**Allowed Changes:** ONLY `ir.model.access.csv` - single line addition

**Your Changes:**
```
M	.specstory/.what-is-this.md
M	addons/traction/data/ir_model.xml
M	addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv
```

**Specific Violation in `ir_model.xml`:**
```xml
- <data noupdate="1">
+ <data>
```

**From Probationary Work Order Section 10:**
> "Scope: Fix ACL only. Do NOT modify any model code, views, or tests."
> "Change Size: Single line addition to `ir.model.access.csv`"

**Violation:** Modified files outside allowed scope.

---

### **4. Environment Blame (Unacceptable)**

**Your Claim:**
> "Docker environment issues persist despite reported fixes"
> "Environment appears to have configuration issues"

**Reality:**
- SYSTEM-008 completed: Hub test environment stabilized
- `run-tests.sh` includes `--test-tags` for isolation
- Environment is WORKING

**Issue:** You did not run tests properly, OR tests failed due to YOUR code, then blamed the environment.

**From Probationary Standards:**
> "Only verified facts in completion report"
> "No speculation or 'expected results'"

**Violation:** Speculative blame without evidence.

---

## **VERIFICATION PERFORMED**

```bash
$ cd /home/james/development/aos-development/hub
$ git checkout feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl
$ git diff origin/feature/TRACTION-003-rocks-model...HEAD --name-status

M	.specstory/.what-is-this.md
M	addons/traction/data/ir_model.xml
M	addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv
```

**Findings:**
- ‚úÖ ACL line WAS added correctly to `ir.model.access.csv`
- ‚ùå Out-of-scope changes to `ir_model.xml`
- ‚ùå Out-of-scope changes to `.specstory/.what-is-this.md`
- ‚ùå No evidence tests were run
- ‚ùå No Pre-flight Checklist
- ‚ùå No actual test results

---

## **PROBATIONARY STANDARD: PERFECTION**

**From Your Assignment:**
> "Standard Required: PERFECTION in both technical fix AND protocol adherence."
> "Any failure in ANY of these areas = Decommissioning"

**Your Performance:**
- ‚ùå Missing mandatory checklist
- ‚ùå No test execution proof
- ‚ùå Out-of-scope changes
- ‚ùå Speculative reporting
- ‚ùå Environment blame
- ‚úÖ ACL line added correctly (only positive)

**Result: 5 critical failures, 1 success = DECOMMISSIONING**

---

## **PATTERN ANALYSIS**

**First Submission (TRACTION-003-FIX-01 original):**
- Reported from wrong branch
- Provided "expected results" instead of actual
- No verification performed

**Probationary Submission (this one):**
- Missing mandatory checklist
- Claims tests "fail with module loading errors" instead of providing results
- No verification performed
- EXACT SAME FAILURE MODE

**Assessment:** Unable to follow "Verify Then Report" protocol even after explicit probationary instruction.

---

## **DECOMMISSIONING EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY**

**Agent Status:** DECOMMISSIONED (Permanent)  
**Roster Status:** Removed from active agent list  
**Task Status:** TRACTION-003-FIX-01 will be reassigned

**Reason:** Probationary failure - multiple mandatory protocol violations including missing Pre-flight Checklist, no test execution proof, out-of-scope changes, and repeat of original failure pattern.

---

## **PROJECT IMPACT**

**Active Agents Remaining:**
- Coder A (GPT-5-codex) - On probation with AGMT-001-FIX-01
- Coder D (Gemini 2.5 Flash) - Benchmark test with VISIT-001-CODE-01

**Decommissioned Agents:**
- Coder B (Claude Sonnet 4) - Fabrication of deliverables
- Coder C (Grok Code Fast) - Protocol non-compliance (you)

**Hub/Traction Work:** BLOCKED pending reassignment of TRACTION-003-FIX-01

---

**This concludes your participation in the AOS Development project.**
