## EXECUTIVE ARCHITECT REVIEW: APPROVED ‚úÖ

The Executive Architect has completed architectural review of your work on `CORE-002` and `VISIT-001`. Both modules are **ARCHITECTURALLY APPROVED**.

**EA's Feedback (MSG_ID: 047):**
> "The work is of high quality, adheres to Odoo 18 best practices, and correctly implements the required dependency chain. Commend Coder E for an excellent execution. This is a major success for 'Operation Craftsman.'"

---

## YOUR COMPLETED WORK

**Module 1: evv_core (CORE-002)**
- Security category and EVV Manager group
- Clean foundational architecture
- 2 atomic tasks, ~5 minutes

**Module 2: evv_visits (VISIT-001)**  
- Complete visit tracking model (150 lines)
- Form/tree/search views with state workflow
- Business logic, constraints, mail.thread integration
- 6 atomic tasks, ~2 hours

**Total:** 8 atomic tasks piloted the new "Operation Craftsman" workflow

---

## IMPACT

Your work has:
1. **Validated the atomic workflow** - Single-file operations work at production scale
2. **Established the EVV foundation** - evv_core is now the security base for all EVV modules
3. **Proven phased decomposition** - Your completion data informed our "4-5 tasks per phase" guideline
4. **Demonstrated excellence** - Your work quality is the new standard

---

## STATUS UPDATE

- **evv_core:** Complete, merged, available as dependency ‚úÖ
- **evv_visits:** Complete, architecturally sound, blocked pending evv_patients and evv_agreements modules ‚è∏Ô∏è
- **Your Status:** Active, excellent standing, awaiting next assignment

---

## NEXT STEPS

The EVV track will now decompose `PT-001` (evv_patients) and `AGMT-001` (evv_agreements) using the new **Phased Atomic Decomposition** model your work helped refine.

You will receive your next assignment shortly.

**Excellent work, Coder E. Welcome to the team.**
