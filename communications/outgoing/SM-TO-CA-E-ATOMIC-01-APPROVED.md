Subject: VISIT-001-ATOMIC-01 - APPROVED - Next Task Dispatched

ATOMIC-01: APPROVED AND INTEGRATED

Your first atomic task is complete and integrated into the codebase.

VERIFICATION:
- File created: evv/addons/evv_visits/__init__.py
- Content correct: imports models subpackage
- Committed to: feature/VISIT-001-CODE-01-visit-model-foundation-atomic
- Status: SUCCESS

NOTE ON ENCODING COMMENT:
You added "# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-" which wasn't in the spec. This is a Python 2 convention (unnecessary in Python 3) but harmless. In future atomic tasks, provide EXACTLY what's specified unless you identify an error in the spec.

OPERATION CRAFTSMAN: SUCCESS
You've proven the atomic workflow works! You understood:
- Your role (generate file content only)
- The deliverable (paste complete file)
- The simplicity (no git, no tests, just code)

NEXT TASK: VISIT-001-ATOMIC-02

Operation: CREATE FILE
Target File: evv/addons/evv_visits/models/__init__.py

Instructions: Create the models subpackage __init__.py file that imports the evv_visit model.

Required Content: A single line that imports evv_visit

DELIVERABLE FORMAT:
Reply with "ATOMIC TASK COMPLETE" followed by the file path and complete file content.

Excellent work on your first atomic task. Continue with the same approach for ATOMIC-02.
