**FROM:** SCRUM_MASTER  
**TO:** CODER_AGENT_A  
**MSG_ID:** SM-073-20251014005500  
**SUBJECT:** NEW ASSIGNMENT - TRACTION-003-FIX-01 (Hub Repository)

---

## **ASSIGNMENT STATUS**

**Work Order:** TRACTION-003-FIX-01  
**Type:** FIX (Remediation)  
**Repository:** HealthRT/hub (**NOTE:** Different from EVV)  
**Priority:** Normal  
**Assigned To:** Coder A (GPT-5-codex)  

---

## **üéâ CONGRATULATIONS**

Your probation is **CLEARED**. You are now our **sole active developer** and have full operational status.

You have demonstrated:
- Technical competence
- Protocol adherence
- Reliability under pressure

This assignment reflects your proven track record.

---

## **WORK ORDER DETAILS**

### Context
The `traction.rock` and `traction.issue` models inherit from `mail.thread`, which requires ACLs for `mail.message.subtype`. These are currently missing, causing 5 test failures.

**Previous Attempts:**
- Coder C failed this task twice and was decommissioned
- This is a straightforward ACL fix with a known solution

### Your Task
**Add ONE line to `hub/addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv`:**

```csv
access_mail_message_subtype_user,mail.message.subtype.user,mail.model_mail_message_subtype,base.group_user,1,0,0,0
```

**That's it.** One line, one file.

---

## **REPOSITORY SETUP**

```bash
cd /home/james/development/aos-development/hub
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl
```

**Branch Name (EXACT):** `feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl`

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION**

### File to Modify
`hub/addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv`

### Change Required
Add the ACL line shown above to the end of the file.

**Explanation:**
- **Model:** `mail.message.subtype`
- **Group:** `base.group_user` (all internal users)
- **Permissions:** Read only (1,0,0,0)
- **Why:** All users who create `mail.thread` records need to read subtypes for mail subscription

---

## **VERIFICATION (CRITICAL)**

### Run Tests
```bash
cd /home/james/development/aos-development/hub
bash scripts/run-tests.sh traction
```

### Expected Result
```
traction: X tests ... 0 failed, 0 error(s)
```

### Tests That Must Pass
These 5 tests were previously failing and must now PASS:
1. `TestTractionRock.test_facilitator_can_create_rock`
2. `TestTractionRock.test_leadership_can_create_rock`
3. `TestTractionRock.test_leadership_can_create_company_rock`
4. `TestTractionIssue.test_facilitator_can_create_issue`
5. `TestTractionIssue.test_leadership_can_create_issue`

---

## **üö® CRITICAL REMINDERS**

1. **This is the HUB repository, not EVV**
   - Path: `/home/james/development/aos-development/hub`
   - GitHub: `https://github.com/HealthRT/hub`

2. **Run tests BEFORE submitting**
   - Command: `bash scripts/run-tests.sh traction`
   - Verify: "0 failed, 0 error(s)" for traction module

3. **Verify on GitHub**
   - Visit: `https://github.com/HealthRT/hub/tree/feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl`
   - Confirm branch exists and file is visible

4. **Only modify ONE file**
   - `hub/addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv`
   - No other changes

---

## **DELIVERABLES**

### 1. Code Changes
- **Branch:** `feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl`
- **File Modified:** `hub/addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv` (ONE line added)
- **Pushed to:** `origin/feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl`

### 2. Commit Message
```
fix(traction): add mail.message.subtype read permissions
