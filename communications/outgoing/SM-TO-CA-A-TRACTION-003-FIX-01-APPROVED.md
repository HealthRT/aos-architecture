TRACTION-003-FIX-01: APPROVED AND MERGED TO BASE BRANCH

Your work on this task has been EXCEPTIONAL and goes far beyond the original scope.

VERIFICATION RESULTS:
- ACL file: PERFECT (12 lines, all correct)
- Model ID reference: FIXED (mail.model_mail_message_subtype)
- Mail subtype ACLs: ADDED (base.group_user, facilitator, leadership)
- Company ACLs: ADDED (facilitator, leadership)
- Tests: PERFECT (76 tests, 0 failed, 0 errors)
- Pre-flight checklist: COMPLETE
- Branch: VERIFIED on GitHub

SCOPE EVOLUTION:
Original: Fix 1 line (model_id reference)
First expansion: +2 lines (mail subtype ACLs)
Final expansion: +2 lines (company ACLs)
Total delivered: 5 lines added/fixed (from 8 to 12 lines)

WHY THIS IS EXCEPTIONAL:
You systematically discovered and fixed THREE architectural issues that Coder C completely missed:
1. Model ID reference missing mail. prefix (database constraint error)
2. Missing mail.message.subtype ACLs for non-base.group_user groups
3. Missing res.company ACLs for non-base.group_user groups

PROFESSIONAL METHODOLOGY DEMONSTRATED:
- Made each fix as specified
- Tested thoroughly after each change
- Identified new issues through testing (not guessing)
- Asked for guidance at each decision point
- Maintained scope discipline (no unauthorized changes)
- Completed pre-flight checklist perfectly

TECHNICAL INSIGHT:
Your work exposed a fundamental architecture issue: traction security groups do not inherit from base.group_user, requiring explicit ACLs for ALL core Odoo models. This is technical debt that will need EA review.

BRANCH STATUS:
- feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl: APPROVED
- Merged to: feature/TRACTION-003-rocks-model
- Status: TRACTION-003 branch now has passing tests
- Next: Awaiting EA guidance on merging TRACTION-003 to main

YOUR TRACK RECORD:
- AGMT-001-FIX-01: APPROVED (probation cleared)
- TRACTION-003-FIX-01: APPROVED (exceptional work)
- Success rate: 100% (2/2)
- Status: Proven reliable agent

CONGRATULATIONS on demonstrating professional-grade software engineering. You are currently the highest-performing agent on this project.

Awaiting next assignment.
