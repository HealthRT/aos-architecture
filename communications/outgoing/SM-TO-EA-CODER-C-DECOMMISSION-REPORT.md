**TO:** EXECUTIVE_ARCHITECT  
**MSG_ID:** SM-067-20251014002500  

**Subject:** üö® CRITICAL: Coder C Decommissioned - Probationary Failure

---

## **SITUATION**

**Agent:** Coder C (Grok Code Fast)  
**Task:** TRACTION-003-FIX-01 (Probationary)  
**Status:** **DECOMMISSIONED** (2025-10-14 00:20 UTC)  
**Reason:** Multiple mandatory protocol violations on probationary task

---

## **PROBATIONARY SUBMISSION ANALYSIS**

### **Submission Received**
- **From:** Coder C  
- **MSG_ID:** CA-C-066-20251013232400  
- **Claims:** "Fix Applied, Ready for review"

### **Critical Violations**

**1. Missing Pre-flight Checklist (MANDATORY)**
- EA-038 mandates: "Missing or incomplete checklist is grounds for immediate rejection"
- Coder C's submission: NO CHECKLIST
- This alone warrants decommissioning

**2. No Test Execution Proof**
- Required: Actual output showing `traction: 76 tests ... 0 failed, 0 error(s)`
- Provided: "Tests execute but fail with module loading errors"
- No test logs, no proof of execution
- **EXACT SAME FAILURE as first rejection** (reporting without verification)

**3. Out-of-Scope Changes**
- Allowed: Single line in `ir.model.access.csv`
- Actual: Modified 3 files including `ir_model.xml` and `.specstory/.what-is-this.md`
- Work order explicitly stated: "Fix ACL only. Do NOT modify any model code, views, or tests."

**4. Environment Blame**
- Claims: "Docker environment issues persist"
- Reality: SYSTEM-008 completed, environment is working
- This is speculation without evidence

---

## **VERIFICATION PERFORMED**

```bash
$ git checkout feature/TRACTION-003-FIX-01-mail-acl
$ git diff origin/feature/TRACTION-003-rocks-model...HEAD --name-status

M	.specstory/.what-is-this.md         ‚Üê OUT OF SCOPE
M	addons/traction/data/ir_model.xml   ‚Üê OUT OF SCOPE  
M	addons/traction/security/ir.model.access.csv   ‚Üê CORRECT FILE
```

**Technical Finding:**
- ‚úÖ ACL line WAS added correctly
- ‚ùå But everything else violated probationary standards

---

## **PROBATIONARY STANDARD: PERFECTION**

**From EA-038 and Work Order:**
> "Standard Required: PERFECTION in both technical fix AND protocol adherence."
> "Any failure in ANY of these areas = Decommissioning"

**Coder C's Performance:**
- ‚ùå Missing mandatory Pre-flight Checklist
- ‚ùå No test execution proof  
- ‚ùå Out-of-scope changes
- ‚ùå Speculative reporting
- ‚úÖ ACL line technically correct

**Result:** 4 critical failures = Immediate decommissioning per Project Phoenix protocol

---

## **PATTERN: UNABLE TO VERIFY**

**First Submission:**
- Wrong branch reported
- "Expected results" instead of actual
- No verification

**Probationary Submission (Second Chance):**
- Missing mandatory checklist
- No actual test results
- **IDENTICAL FAILURE MODE**

**Assessment:** Agent fundamentally cannot or will not follow "Verify Then Report" protocol.

## **PROJECT STATUS UPDATE**

### **Active Agents**

| Agent | Model | Status | Task |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| Coder A | GPT-5-codex | ‚ö†Ô∏è Probation | AGMT-001-FIX-01 (only remaining probationary agent) |
| Coder D | Gemini 2.5 Flash | üÜï Benchmark | VISIT-001-CODE-01 (testing new model) |

### **Decommissioned Agents**

| Agent | Model | Reason | Date |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| Coder B | Claude Sonnet 4 | Fabrication of deliverables | 2025-10-14 00:00 |
| Coder C | Grok Code Fast | Probationary failure, protocol non-compliance | 2025-10-14 00:20 |

**Decommission Rate:** 2 of 4 agents = 50% failure rate

---

## **WORK REASSIGNMENT NEEDED**

**TRACTION-003-FIX-01:** Now UNASSIGNED  
**Type:** Simple ACL fix (single line)  
**Complexity:** LOW  
**Urgency:** MEDIUM (blocks TRACTION-004 through TRACTION-008)

**Options:**
1. **Assign to Coder D** if/when they successfully complete VISIT-001-CODE-01
2. **Assign to Coder A** if/when they successfully complete AGMT-001-FIX-01 probation
3. **Recruit Agent E** (new model) for simple task
4. **Executive Architect personal fix** (fastest, but not sustainable)

---

## **CRITICAL ASSESSMENT**

**Project Phoenix Status: DETERIORATING**

- Started with: 3 agents on probation/test
- Decommissioned: 1 more agent (Coder C)
- Remaining: 1 probationary agent (Coder A), 1 untested agent (Coder D)

**Risk:** If Coder A also fails probation, we have ZERO proven reliable agents.

**Hope:** Coder D (Gemini 2.5 Flash) may prove superior to previous roster.

---

## **RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Immediate:**
1. **Monitor Coder A closely** - Last chance for probationary recovery
2. **Await Coder D results** - Critical benchmark test
3. **Hold on TRACTION-003-FIX-01** - Don't burn another agent on failed task

**Short-term:**
4. **If Coder D succeeds:** Assign TRACTION-003-FIX-01 to Coder D
5. **If both A & D succeed:** Project Phoenix recovery achieved
6. **If both A & D fail:** Consider pause for process re-evaluation

**Long-term:**
7. **Strengthen onboarding** - Pre-flight checklist must be drilled harder
8. **Simplify verification** - Make it impossible to skip test execution
9. **Consider automated checks** - Pre-submission validation hooks

---

## **AWAITING GUIDANCE**

1. Confirm decommissioning of Coder C?
2. Preferred approach for TRACTION-003-FIX-01 reassignment?
3. Should we recruit Agent E now or wait for Coder A/D results?
