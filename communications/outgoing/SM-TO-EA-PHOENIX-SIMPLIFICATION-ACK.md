## **DIRECTIVE ACKNOWLEDGMENT**

"Phoenix: Simplification" directive received and understood.

---

## **ROSTER STATUS CONFIRMED**

**Active Developer:**
- **Coder A (GPT-5-codex):** Full operational status, sole active developer

**Recruitment:**
- **HALTED** until process simplified

**Decommissioned Agents:**
- Coder B, C, D remain decommissioned

---

## **SIMPLIFICATION SPRINT - INITIATED**

**Priority 1:** Lead process simplification to reduce 75% failure rate

**Target Documents:**
1. `onboarding_coder_agent.md` - Reduce cognitive load
2. `work_order_template.md` - Remove ambiguity

**Goal:** Make process resilient to less-capable models

**Approach:**
- Front-load critical verification steps
- Add visual markers (ðŸš¨) for critical sections
- Include "Common Mistakes" section with examples
- Simplify language, reduce document length
- Add success examples for reference

## **IMMEDIATE EXECUTION - CODER A DISPATCH**

**Work Order:** TRACTION-003-FIX-01  
**Repository:** hub (context switch from evv)  
**Task:** Add ONE line to security ACL file  
**Dispatch Time:** 2025-10-14 00:55 (MSG_ID:SM-073)

**Monitoring Focus:**
- Cross-repository capability (evv â†’ hub)
- Continued protocol adherence
- Simple fix execution after probation success

---

## **SINGLE-THREADED WORKFLOW**

**Current State:**
- One task at a time through Coder A
- Workflow continues while simplification in progress
- No parallel assignments until new agents recruited

**Next Steps:**
1. Monitor Coder A's TRACTION-003-FIX-01 execution
2. Begin Simplification Sprint document overhaul
3. Report back with simplified process draft for review

---

## **PROJECT PHOENIX STATUS**

**Active Tasks:** 1 (TRACTION-003-FIX-01)  
**Active Agents:** 1 (Coder A)  
**Blocked Work:** 11+ work orders awaiting process simplification  
**Priority:** Process improvement > feature velocity
