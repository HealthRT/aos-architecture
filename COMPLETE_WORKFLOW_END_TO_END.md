## üèõÔ∏è **GOVERNANCE: THE IMMUTABLE CORE**

Our entire process is governed by the **Immutable Core Framework (ADR-009)**. This separates our project artifacts into three rings of authority:

1.  **Ring 0: The Immutable Core (`/prompts/core/`)**
    -   **What:** The "constitution" of the project (`00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`). Contains the absolute, unchangeable laws.
    -   **Who Can Change:** Only the human overseer. Changes are technically blocked for all other users and AIs via pre-commit hooks.

2.  **Ring 1: The Protected Layer (`/standards`, `/prompts`, `/templates`)**
    -   **What:** Our operational standards, agent primers, and templates. These are the "laws" that define our workflow.
    -   **Who Can Change:** The Executive Architect AI can propose changes based on trends, but they **must** be approved by the human overseer before being merged.

3.  **Ring 2: The Adaptive Layer (`/process_improvement`, GitHub Issues)**
    -   **What:** The "suggestion box." Contains the raw feedback, logs, and discussions generated by our agents.
    -   **Who Can Change:** All agents contribute to this layer as part of their workflow.

## üõ°Ô∏è **QUALITY SAFEGUARDS**

Our workflow includes multiple quality gates to prevent issues from reaching production:

### **Work Order Quality Validation**

**Automated Script:** `scripts/validate-work-order.sh`

Validates every work order before dispatch:
- ‚úÖ No prohibited phrases ("tests optional", etc.)
- ‚úÖ Testing Requirements section present
- ‚úÖ Testing standards reference included
- ‚úÖ Proof of Execution section complete
- ‚úÖ All required structural sections present

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/validate-work-order.sh path/to/WO-XXX.md
```

**Integration Points:**
- Scrum Master self-check (mandatory before submission)
- Architect pre-dispatch review
- Can be added to pre-commit hooks or GitHub Actions

**Rationale:** Process Improvement Entry #005 documented that "tests optional" language led to incomplete implementations. Automated validation prevents recurrence.

## üîÑ **COMPLETE WORKFLOW - STEP BY STEP**

---

### **PHASE 1: DEFINITION (The "Upstream" / Agentic Planning)**

#### **Step 1.1: Ideation & Feature Brief**
- **Who:** Human Overseer & Executive Architect
- **What:** A high-level strategic idea is discussed. If deemed viable, the Architect creates a **Feature Brief** in the `/features` directory.

#### **Step 1.2: Specification Creation**
- **Who:** Business Analyst (BA) AI Agent
- **Trigger:** A directive from the Architect to create a spec for a Feature Brief.
- **Action:** The BA reads the Feature Brief and all relevant ADRs, then creates a detailed **`Story.yaml`** specification file in the `/specs` directory, following the official `STORY.yaml.tpl` template.

#### **Step 1.3: The "Upstream" Feedback Loop (Technical Review)**
- **Who:** Coder Agent
- **Trigger:** The BA agent finishes a `Story.yaml` and a `status:needs-technical-review` label is applied.
- **Action (ADR-008):** A Coder Agent is assigned to review the YAML spec for technical feasibility, clarity, and completeness.

#### **Step 1.4: Final Architect & Human Approval**
- **Who:** Executive Architect & Human Overseer
- **Action:** The architect performs a final review of the technically-vetted `Story.yaml`. Upon approval, an "Epic" issue is created in the `aos-architecture` repository to track its overall progress. The human overseer gives the final go-ahead.

---

### **PHASE 2: DECOMPOSITION & DISPATCH**

#### **Step 2.1: Work Order Creation**
- **Who:** Scrum Master Agent (or Executive Architect)
- **Action:** The Scrum Master agent reads the approved `Story.yaml` and decomposes it into one or more "nuclear" Work Orders.
- **Deliverable:** The agent creates a separate `.md` file for each Work Order and places it in the `aos-architecture/work_orders/pending/` directory.

#### **Step 2.2: Review and Dispatch**
- **Who:** Human Overseer (guided by the Coach AI)
- **Action:**
    1.  The human overseer reviews the pending Work Order files in the `/work_orders/pending/` directory.
    2.  Once a Work Order is approved for dispatch, the overseer executes the `dispatch.sh` script from the command line, providing the path to the Work Order file.
    3.  The script automatically creates the corresponding GitHub Issue in the correct repository and moves the source file to `/work_orders/dispatched/`.

---

### **PHASE 3: IMPLEMENTATION (The "Downstream")**

#### **Step 3.1: Execution**
- **Who:** Coder Agent
- **Action:** The agent executes the Work Order in a separate feature branch, following all standards, including the **2-iteration limit** for bug fixing. If it gets stuck, it escalates by applying the `status:needs-help` label.

#### **Step 3.2: The "Downstream" Feedback Loop & Handoff**
- **Who:** Coder Agent
- **Action:**
    1.  Upon successful completion, the agent provides the mandatory **"Proof of Execution"** (including test results) as a comment on the GitHub issue.
    2.  The agent also provides structured **Process Improvement Feedback** as a separate comment, answering the three standard questions (Context, Clarity, Tooling).

#### **Step 3.3: Architectural Review & Merge**
- **Who:** Executive Architect & Human Overseer
- **Action:**
    1.  The Architect reviews the PR and the Proof of Execution.
    2.  Upon approval, the Architect posts an "Approved for Merge" comment.
    3.  The **Human Overseer performs the final, authoritative merge** of the Pull Request into the `main` branch. This is a non-negotiable step.

---

### **PHASE 4: PROCESS IMPROVEMENT**

#### **Step 4.1: Logging and Trend Analysis**
- **Who:** Executive Architect
- **Action (ADR-008):** The Architect logs all agent feedback in `process_improvement/process-improvement.md`, analyzes it for trends, and proposes changes to the "Protected Layer" only when a clear pattern of inefficiency or error emerges. All changes require human approval.

---

## üîç **KEY QUESTIONS ANSWERED**

### **Who Creates Work Orders?**

**Answer:** Business Analyst (BA) AI Agent OR Human BA

**Process:**
1. BA reads user story
2. BA decomposes into atomic work orders
3. BA creates GitHub Issues in target repo (hub/evv)
4. BA uses Work Order Template (mandatory structure)
5. BA assigns labels for routing

**Context Management Note:**
- BA MUST size work orders to fit agent context budget
- Target: < 500 lines of changes
- If larger: Break into multiple work orders
- Document dependencies

---

### **Where is Context Management Considered?**

**Answer:** At MULTIPLE levels:

1. **Work Order Creation (BA Agent):**
   - Size work appropriately (< 500 lines)
   - Clear scope definition
   - Single responsibility

2. **Work Order Template:**
   - Section 6: Context Management guidelines
   - 2-iteration limit documented
   - Escalation process provided

3. **Coder Agent Workflow:**
   - Git checkpoints (external memory)
   - Phase-based context budget (30% per phase)
   - Iteration limit enforcement
   - Escalation triggers

4. **Testing Standards:**
   - Workflow documented
   - Escalation path clear
   - Signs of context exhaustion

**Key Point:** Context management is ARCHITECTURAL, not just tactical!

---

### **When Does Same Agent vs Separate Agent Apply?**

**Answer:** Default is SAME agent, separate only for complex cases

**Same Agent (90% of tasks):**
- Task < 500 lines
- Standard refactoring
- Feature implementation
- Bug fixes
- Documentation

**Separate Test Agent (10% of tasks):**
- Task > 500 lines
- High bug risk (security, critical logic)
- Complex refactoring
- Coder already used 50%+ context

**Decision Made By:** BA during work order creation OR Developer during dispatch

---

### **What Happens When Agent Gets Stuck?**

**Answer:** 2-iteration limit ‚Üí Escalation

**Process:**
1. Agent tries fix (Iteration 1)
2. If fails, agent tries DIFFERENT fix (Iteration 2)
3. If still fails, agent STOPS and escalates
4. Agent documents attempts on GitHub Issue
5. Agent adds `status:needs-help` label
6. Agent tags reviewer
7. Human/specialist reviews and assists

**Why This Works:**
- Prevents context exhaustion
- Documents what was tried (no duplication)
- Gets expert help early
- Preserves agent context for useful work
