"Topic","Details","Status","Date Raised","SME Owner","SME Feedback","Decision"
"Unit of Service Definition","CRITICAL: The mn_245d_hcbs_summary.md states units can be variable, but our assumption has been ""1 Unit = 15 minutes"". Must the MVP support configurable unit definitions per payer, or is a single 15-minute rule safe? The previous decision to use a 15-minute unit is now being re-evaluated.","High Priority - Blocking","2025-10-04","","",""
"Multi-Segment Rounding","When a visit has multiple segments for the same service (e.g., two 7-minute segments), should we sum the total minutes *before* rounding, or round each segment individually?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Unit Cap Window Definitions","Are unit caps (daily, weekly) based on calendar windows (midnight-to-midnight, Sun-Sat) or rolling windows (last 24 hours, last 7 days)?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Short-Segment Handling","How should the system handle segments shorter than the 8-minute minimum? Should they be automatically discarded, flagged for review, or rounded up to 1 unit?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Supervisor Override Policy","1. What user roles can override (Supervisor, Admin, DSP)? 2. If a DSP can self-correct, is there a grace period (e.g., 5 mins)? 3. Which errors are overridable? 4. Is a justification note required? 5. Do overrides use an ""override bucket"" or adjust balances? 6. Is a special modifier needed on the claim?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Supervisor Review UI","To approve a visit, what is the most critical information to display on the supervisor review screen (e.g., remaining units, recent client visits, validation warning flags)?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Service Agreement Carryover","Do service agreements support carryover (unused units roll to the next period), or is it always ""use-it-or-lose-it""?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"Service Agreement Import Logic","When a new service agreement is imported, should it replace existing agreements for the client, or be added alongside them (e.g., a Jan-Jun agreement followed by a Jul-Dec agreement)?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-04","","",""
"DSP Identifier","The 837P guide requires a Rendering Provider NPI. Do our DSPs have individual NPIs, or is there another unique ID we must use for them on claims?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-05","","",""
"**Group Home Workflow vs. No Overlap**","**CRITICAL**: User story `WORKFLOW_GROUP_HOME_001` requires concurrent, overlapping visits for a DSP in a group home, which conflicts with our ""No Overlap"" rule. Does the ""No Overlap"" rule apply strictly to a DSP (can never have 2 visits at once), or to a DSP/Client pair (can't have 2 visits for the same client at once)?","**High Priority - Blocking**","2025-10-05","","",""
"Billing Modifier Handling","User story `WORKFLOW_GROUP_HOME_001` specifies the `U1` modifier will be inferred. For other modifiers (`HQ`, `GT`, `U2`), should they be manually selected by the DSP during a visit, or are there other workflows where they should be inferred?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-05","","",""
"Geo-Fencing MVP Scope","`validation_rules.md` lists a `VISIT_OUTSIDE_GEOFENCE` rule, but there is no user story for it. Is Geo-Fencing a requirement for the MVP? If so, we will need a user story and data model updates.","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-05","","",""
"Provider Match on Service Agreements","`validation_rules.md` requires the DSP to match the provider on the Service Agreement. Does an agreement authorize only a single provider, or can it authorize a list/team of providers?","Pending SME Feedback","2025-10-05","","",""
