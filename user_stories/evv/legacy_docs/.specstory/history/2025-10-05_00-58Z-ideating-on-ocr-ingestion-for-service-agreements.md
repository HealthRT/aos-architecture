# Ideating on OCR ingestion for service agreements (2025-10-05 00:58Z)

_**User (2025-10-04 23:42Z)**_

You are an arcittech and business analyis for our EVV system built on Odoo.

lets ideate on the OCR ingestion of Serviuce Agreements proivided by the state. Perhaps a review workflow of service agreements to avoid potiental errors. Let see what tech and effort might be required to implement this in odoo

before doing so, review @context_primer.md  and let me know what questions you have, one by one

---

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Service Agreements**

I'm currently focused on how to efficiently get service agreements into the system. OCR ingestion is the core, and the goal is to minimize errors. A review workflow will be key. Next, I'll begin analyzing the tech and effort required for Odoo integration.


**Reading Context and Planning**

I've reviewed the context primer, zeroing in on service agreements and their relationship to visit validation. The crucial link is the `service_code` field and how it aligns. Now, I am formulating questions around the required data extraction from the agreements, the expected variability in agreement formats, and the implications of the MVP's limited scope.


**Clarifying Data Requirements**

I've finished the context primer review. Now, I'm concentrating on data extraction. What specific data fields beyond the MVP's scope will be needed later? Also, what agreement format diversity should I anticipate and how will I handle it? Considering the unknowns outlined in the context primer, how can the OCR process be designed to accommodate these uncertainties?


**Defining Input and Parsing**

I'm now focusing on the input and parsing steps for OCR. What kind of files will I be dealing with? Scanned or digital PDFs? This directly affects OCR choice and parsing complexity. Then, I'll define the `cap_window` semantics. Examples are key here!


**Probing Source Agreement Formats**

I'm shifting focus to the fundamental question: What's the source document format? Scanned or digital PDFs? The answer drastically affects the OCR tech needed. Then, what do the different `cap_window` options look like? Clear examples are a must to reliably extract this critical data element from agreements.


**Formulating the First Question**

I've reviewed the context primer document as instructed, focusing on Service Agreements. My initial question, crucial for guiding OCR technology selection and parsing design, is: What is the format of the Service Agreements provided by the state? Are they scanned PDFs, digital PDFs with text, or structured data formats like XML or JSON?


**Inquiring Document Format**

I've reviewed the context primer and am now focused on the critical first step: understanding the source document format. My initial inquiry centers on this: Are the service agreements provided by the state scanned PDFs, digital PDFs with selectable text, or in a structured format like XML or JSON? This fundamental information is essential to guide OCR selection and parsing design.


</details></think>

Of course. I have reviewed the `context_primer.md` document. It provides an excellent foundation for the EVV system's architecture and business logic.

Before we dive into ideating on the OCR solution for Service Agreements, I have a few questions to clarify some points that will directly impact the design and effort required. I will ask them one by one as you requested.

First, what is the format of the Service Agreement documents we receive from the state? Are they typically scanned image-based PDFs, text-selectable (digital) PDFs, or something else entirely? The answer will significantly influence the choice of OCR technology and the complexity of the data extraction process.

---

_**User (2025-10-04 23:42Z)**_

they look like image scanned PDFs at this time. Semi strictured. We may be able to retrivebe via SFTP, but in the near term we'll asumme someone is downloading the PDF from MN-ITS and uploading to our EVV app;lication.

I can proivide a sample PDF if that helps

---

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing OCR Requirements**

I'm starting to formulate a plan for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) processing of these service agreements. Since the documents are image-based PDFs, the initial approach needs to focus on efficient image preprocessing to ensure optimal text extraction. The manual upload process suggests the need for a user-friendly interface, too.


**Clarifying PDF Structure**

I've received confirmation that the documents are scanned image PDFs, which I understand is key to the OCR challenge. To proceed, I need to assess the document's structure. So, my next query will focus on identifying the key data points within the Service Agreements and how consistently they appear in each document. This information will help refine the OCR approach.


**Structuring Document Extraction**

I've now refined the information-gathering strategy. Since direct PDF access is off-limits, I'm pivoting towards understanding the PDF's structure. My focus is on identifying key data fields within the Service Agreements. The next step is to understand if these fields' locations are consistent across documents, which directly influences OCR complexity. This will inform the choice of OCR tools for the project.


</details></think>

---

Thank you, that's very helpful. Knowing they are scanned image PDFs clarifies the initial technical path.

While I can't view a sample PDF directly, you can describe its structure to me. My next question is:

What are the key data points we need to extract from the Service Agreement? Based on the `context_primer.md`, I expect fields like `individual_id`, `service_code`, `units_authorized`, `start_date`, and `end_date`. Are these fields consistently located in the same position on every document, or does the layout vary? For example, is 'Start Date' always in the top-right corner, or can it move around?

_**User (2025-10-04 23:42Z)**_

you can find information on the fields at@mnits_service_agreement_v1.spec.md 
Their location may change, I will have to check

---

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning OCR Ingestion**

I'm now focused on the manual upload process for these scanned PDFs. Initial thoughts are around structuring the import pipeline and how to best handle the semi-structured nature of the documents. I need to figure out the initial OCR approach and how to parse the text data after it's obtained. The `contracts/imports` directory will be my starting point, it seems.


**Reconciling CSV vs. OCR**

I've realized the discrepancy between the initial OCR request and the provided CSV import spec. The `mnits_service_agreement_v1.spec.md` file details a CSV structure, not a PDF layout. I need to clarify whether OCR is the primary goal or if we're moving towards a CSV import from the start. My focus has now shifted to mapping the OCR output to the fields outlined in the CSV specification, if OCR is indeed the target.


**Assessing PDF Structure**

I'm now analyzing the `mnits_service_agreement_v1.spec.md` file to understand the data points needed from the PDFs. It seems the CSV spec is the guide to the fields, not the import format. The primary challenge is to identify the layout variability in the scanned documents, as the user has indicated that the field locations are subject to change. This will determine the best OCR approach, and guide me in preparing the right questions.


**Proposing a Review Workflow**

I've focused on the "location may change" statement. Now I am framing a question about the role of human review in the process. The user will need to review results because of variable PDF layouts. This line of questioning will help identify the workflow for error corrections. My assumption is that the system attempts OCR, and the admin reviews the results for correction.


**Defining a Review Workflow**

I'm framing the question: Considering the provided CSV spec and the possibility of changing field locations in the PDFs, it's clear that a manual review step will be necessary. I am asking the user about the criticality of 100% accuracy on the first pass and proposing an admin review workflow. This helps assess the effort required.


**Questioning Data Variability**

I'm now focusing on the provided CSV spec and the known variability in field locations within the scanned PDFs. My proposed question clarifies a review workflow. Given the likelihood of OCR errors due to changing layouts, I'm asking the user about the importance of first-pass accuracy and proposing an admin review process for data correction. This will help me understand the level of automation and effort needed.


**Proposing Review & Validation**

I've now read the CSV spec file, confirming it defines the desired data fields. Considering the variable field locations in the scanned PDFs, and the need to import the data into Odoo, I'm proposing a review workflow. I'm asking the user about the necessity of 100% first-pass accuracy and envisioning an admin review step for corrections.


</details></think>

---

Thank you for sharing the field specification. It clearly lists all the data points we need to capture from the Service Agreements.

That brings me to my next question, which focuses on the review workflow you mentioned in your first message. Given that the field locations on the PDF might change from document to document, a purely automated OCR process will likely have a certain error rate. A human review step seems essential to ensure data accuracy.

How critical is 100% accuracy on the first pass? Are you envisioning a workflow where an administrator:
1.  Uploads the scanned PDF.
2.  The system attempts to extract the data automatically.
3.  The admin is then shown a screen with the original document on one side and the extracted, editable data fields on the other for verification and correction before the Service Agreement is formally created in Odoo?

_**User (2025-10-04 23:42Z)**_

I think human review is prudent. Perhaps we can add a "no chajges were required" to the approval workflow so we can track sucess rate of the OCR work

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping Out the Workflow**

I'm currently focused on the OCR ingestion workflow for service agreements in Odoo. I've confirmed the document source and the extraction specifications. Now, I'm moving on to designing a human review workflow to refine the extracted data.


**Breaking Down Components**

My focus has shifted to the core components, specifically the OCR service. I'm weighing cloud-based AI services against open-source options. The cloud services offer strong pre-trained models for form processing, while open-source options offer integration flexibility. Now, I'm assessing the trade-offs between these approaches, considering factors like cost, accuracy, and implementation effort.


**Decomposing the Tasks**

I'm currently building out the task breakdown for effort estimation. This phase will begin with an OCR service evaluation (likely AWS Textract). The next step will involve creating the staging model, then building the review view within Odoo. I'm also outlining specific considerations for the POC phase.


**Mapping the Next Steps**

I'm now focusing on the core technology choices and effort estimates. First, I'll select an OCR service; AWS Textract is leading the way. After that, a POC phase involving a basic Python script for extraction and a simple Odoo module for testing, then the review view design and build, which is the most complicated aspect.


**Structuring the Solution**

I've finalized the overall workflow, encompassing upload, processing with OCR, human review, verification, and record creation in Odoo. Now, I'm outlining core components: the OCR service choice (cloud-based vs. open-source) and the Odoo module design, including a staging model, controller, and review view. I'm also structuring the effort estimation by breaking it down into phases, which will allow the team to start prototyping quickly, and then building on the initial POC.


**Structuring the Plan**

I've just finished structuring the workflow for extracting data from scanned PDFs. My current plan is to start with a Proof of Concept using a Python script and AWS Textract. Then, I'll integrate this into a custom Odoo module, including a staging model and a review view. Finally, I'll address error handling, security, and performance considerations in the final stage, and am planning a phased implementation to manage the project effectively.


</details></think>

---

Excellent idea. Tracking the success rate with a "no changes were required" flag is a great way to measure the ROI of the OCR implementation and identify if the document format from the state changes over time.

Based on our conversation, here is a summary of the proposed workflow we've outlined:

1.  **Upload**: An administrator uploads a scanned PDF of a Service Agreement into a dedicated view in Odoo.
2.  **Automated Extraction**: The system sends the PDF to an OCR service, which reads the document and extracts the key data fields.
3.  **Verification**: The Odoo interface then presents a "Verification View" showing the original PDF on one side and the extracted data populated in Odoo form fields on the other.
4.  **Review & Correction**: The administrator reviews the extracted data for accuracy. If any data is incorrect or missing, they can edit the fields directly.
5.  **Confirmation**: The administrator clicks a "Confirm" button. The system logs whether any changes were made and then creates the official `ServiceAgreement` record in the system using the verified data.

This workflow balances automation with the need for human oversight, ensuring data integrity, which is critical.

Now, let's explore the technology and effort required to implement this in Odoo. We can break it down into two main components: the **OCR Engine** and the **Custom Odoo Module**.

### 1. OCR Engine: The "Brain"

This is the technology that actually reads the PDF. We have two main approaches:

*   **Cloud-based AI Document Processing (Recommended):**
    *   **Examples**: AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision AI, Azure Form Recognizer.
    *   **How it Works**: These services are specifically designed to understand and extract data from forms and tables, even if the layout varies. You send them the PDF via an API call, and they return structured data (like JSON) mapping labels to values (e.g., `"StartDate": "2025-01-01"`).
    *   **Pros**:
        *   **Higher Accuracy**: Much more accurate for semi-structured forms than generic OCR.
        *   **Less Maintenance**: No need to manage servers or update OCR software.
        *   **Faster Implementation**: We can focus on the Odoo workflow rather than tuning an OCR engine.
    *   **Cons**:
        *   **Cost**: There is a per-page or per-document cost, though it's typically very low.
        *   **Data Privacy**: We would need to ensure the service has a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) for HIPAA compliance, which all major cloud providers offer.

*   **Self-hosted Open Source OCR:**
    *   **Examples**: Tesseract OCR library.
    *   **How it Works**: We would install and manage the OCR library on our own server. It would require significant configuration and potentially custom code to identify where the data fields are located on the page.
    *   **Pros**:
        *   **No Per-Page Cost**: The software itself is free.
        *   **Full Control**: Data never leaves our infrastructure.
    *   **Cons**:
        *   **High Implementation Effort**: Very time-consuming to set up, tune, and maintain.
        *   **Lower Accuracy**: Tends to be less accurate for variable form layouts and requires perfect scans.

**Recommendation**: For this use case, a cloud-based service like **AWS Textract** is the clear winner. The higher accuracy and reduced development effort will provide a much faster path to a working, reliable solution.

### 2. Custom Odoo Module: The "Body"

This is where the user interaction happens. We would need to develop a new Odoo module to orchestrate the entire process.

*   **Key Components & Effort:**
    1.  **Staging Model**: Create a new, temporary model in Odoo (e.g., `service.agreement.staging`) to hold the data extracted from the OCR before it's confirmed. This would include fields for the PDF itself, the extracted data, the reviewer, and the "no changes required" flag.
    2.  **API Integration**: Write the Python code within Odoo to securely call the chosen OCR service (e.g., AWS Textract), send the uploaded PDF, and parse the JSON response.
    3.  **Verification View (UI/UX)**: This is the most significant piece of development work. We would need to create a custom Odoo view that:
        *   Has a file upload widget.
        *   Displays the uploaded PDF in an embedded viewer.
        *   Presents the extracted data in editable Odoo form fields next to the PDF viewer.
    4.  **Workflow Logic**: Implement the "Confirm" button functionality that validates the data, creates the final `ServiceAgreement` record from the staging data, and archives the staging record.

### Phased Implementation Plan

To manage risk and effort, I propose the following phased approach:

*   **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (~1-2 weeks)**
    *   Select an OCR service (e.g., AWS Textract).
    *   Using a sample PDF, write a standalone Python script to prove we can reliably extract the required fields.
    *   **Goal**: De-risk the core technical challenge—data extraction.

*   **Phase 2: Core Workflow Build (~3-5 weeks)**
    *   Develop the custom Odoo module with the staging model and API integration.
    *   Build the first version of the Verification View.
    *   Implement the confirmation logic.
    *   **Goal**: Have a functional, end-to-end workflow for a single user.

*   **Phase 3: Productionizing & Refinement (~2-3 weeks)**
    *   Add robust error handling (e.g., for unreadable PDFs).
    *   Refine the UI/UX based on initial feedback.
    *   Implement user roles/permissions for who can upload and verify agreements.
    *   Add reporting to track the OCR success rate.
    *   **Goal**: A polished, secure, and production-ready feature.

This approach breaks the project into manageable pieces and ensures we validate the most critical assumptions early on.

Does this high-level plan for the technology and implementation effort align with your expectations?

_**User (2025-10-04 23:42Z)**_

could tabula be used to extract the data from the PDF in a programattic manner?

---

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Defining Tabula's Capabilities**

I've confirmed the core question: can Tabula be used programmatically for PDF data extraction? I'm now focused on defining Tabula's specific capabilities. It appears to be tailored for extracting data from PDFs, but I need to understand how effectively it handles the nuances of table structures. Does it need manual intervention?


**Examining Tabula's Limitations**

I'm now scrutinizing Tabula's limitations based on the user's requirements. I'm realizing that Tabula's strength, extracting data from tables, may not directly address the semi-structured nature of the provided form. I have to consider how adaptable Tabula is if the location of the key-value pairs shifts across different service agreements, which the user states might be the case.


**Assessing Data Extraction Methods**

I'm now comparing Tabula with alternative solutions, like AWS Textract, to identify the best fit for extracting key-value pairs. Tabula excels with tables, while document processing services better handle forms. Considering the user's needs and potential layout inconsistencies, a document processing service seems more promising for achieving robust results.


**Evaluating Tabula's Suitability**

I've now finished a thorough assessment of Tabula and its fit for the user's requirements. My analysis highlights the fundamental mismatch between Tabula's table-focused capabilities and the semi-structured nature of the service agreements. Considering the varying layouts, Tabula's limitations become more apparent, leaning towards an alternative solution.


**Assessing the Core Issue**

I've now articulated the fundamental conflict: the user requires data extraction from semi-structured forms, while Tabula excels at tabular data. This mismatch presents significant challenges, especially with image-scanned PDFs and potentially inconsistent layouts. I'm currently formulating how to convey the incompatibility most effectively.


**Summarizing Key Differences**

I'm now honing in on the contrast between Tabula and the AI document processing services. It's all clicking into place. Tabula deals with tables; the user has forms. Variable layouts and scanned documents further solidify the mismatch. I can use the core idea of layout instability against Tabula.


</details></think>

---

That's an excellent question. `Tabula` is a powerful and popular open-source tool, and it's smart to consider it.

However, for this specific use case, **`Tabula` is likely not the right tool**.

Here's a breakdown of why:

1.  **`Tabula` is for Tables, Not Forms**: `Tabula`'s core strength is extracting data from well-defined *tables* with clear rows and columns inside a PDF. A Service Agreement, as you've described it, is a *form* containing key-value pairs (e.g., a label like "Start Date" followed by a value "2025-01-01"). `Tabula` is not designed to intelligently identify a label and find its corresponding value, especially if they aren't in a rigid grid.

2.  **`Tabula` Cannot Read Scanned Images (No OCR)**: This is the most critical limitation for your project. The documents are "image scanned PDFs," meaning the pages are essentially pictures of text. `Tabula` does not have a built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine. It can only extract text that already exists digitally in the PDF. To make `Tabula` work, you would first need to run the PDF through a separate OCR engine (like Tesseract), which adds another layer of complexity and potential for error. The layout information can be lost or garbled during that OCR step, making `Tabula`'s job even harder.

3.  **It Struggles with Variable Layouts**: You mentioned the location of fields may change. `Tabula` works best programmatically when you can give it specific coordinates on the page where the table resides. If the "table" of information moves from one document to the next, your code would constantly break or require a very complex and fragile layer of logic to try and "find" the table first.

### How is this different from AWS Textract (and similar services)?

Services like **AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision, and Azure Form Recognizer** are fundamentally different from `Tabula`. They are not just table extractors; they are AI-powered document intelligence platforms that:

*   **Perform high-accuracy OCR** on scanned images automatically.
*   Are specifically trained to understand **form structures (key-value pairs)** in addition to tables.
*   Use machine learning to **adapt to variations in layout**, identifying labels and values even if they move around the page.

**In summary:**

| Feature | `Tabula` | AWS Textract / Google Vision |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Use Case** | Extracting **tables** from digital PDFs. | Extracting data from **forms, tables, and raw text**. |
| **Handles Scanned PDFs?** | **No (Requires separate OCR step)** | **Yes (Built-in)** |
| **Handles Variable Layouts?** | Poorly. Relies on fixed coordinates. | Well. Uses ML to find fields. |
| **Setup Effort** | High (Multi-step pipeline: OCR -> Tabula) | Low (Single API call) |
| **Accuracy on Forms** | Low | High |

While `Tabula` is an excellent choice if you have thousands of digital PDFs with the *exact same table layout*, for the challenge of extracting data from semi-structured, scanned forms, a dedicated AI document processing service remains the far more reliable and efficient solution.

---

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Pinpointing User Needs**

I'm now homing in on the user's primary goal: extracting specific data fields from images, going far beyond simple OCR. The challenge is to move from mere text recognition to a system with contextual understanding and targeted extraction capabilities.


**Elaborating on IDP Solutions**

I'm now fleshing out the explanation, focusing on *how* the recommended IDP tools, like AWS Textract, Google Cloud Vision AI, and Azure Form Recognizer, work. I'll emphasize their ability to go beyond basic OCR by incorporating AI-driven field extraction and understanding document structure.


**Formulating IDP Explanation**

Now, I'm structuring the response. I'll start by labeling the technology as Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). Next, I'll re-introduce the top cloud-based solutions. I'll then break down how each extracts key-value pairs. Finally, I'll create a comparison table, considering features, HIPAA compliance, Odoo integration ease, and pricing models to help the user choose.


**Detailing Extraction Process**

I'm clarifying how the IDP tools I mentioned actually *work*. They're trained on massive datasets of documents, enabling them to recognize document patterns. This allows them to accurately identify "keys" (like "Date:") and their corresponding "values" (the actual date). I'll emphasize that this goes far beyond simple OCR.


**Structuring the Explanation**

I'm now organizing the answer, leading with "Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)" as the correct terminology, and re-emphasizing the three cloud-based tools. I'll explain each's key-value pair extraction capabilities, with a focus on AWS Textract's maturity and suitability, especially its `AnalyzeDocument` API.


</details></think>

---

You've hit on the key difference between basic OCR and modern document processing. The technology you're describing is often called **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)** or AI-powered OCR.

These services don't just turn an image into a block of text. They use machine learning models trained on millions of documents to understand the *structure and context* of the content. They can intelligently identify a field label (a "key") and then locate and extract its corresponding "value," even if the position changes slightly between documents.

The top-tier services that excel at this are the ones I recommended earlier. Let's dive into exactly how they achieve this.

### The Top 3 OCR Services for Intelligent Field Extraction

1.  **AWS Textract**
    *   **How it "Reads" Fields**: This is Textract's core feature. You use its `AnalyzeDocument` API and specify you want to extract `FORMS`. It returns a structured response that explicitly links labels to values. For example, it will return a data block that says: "Key: `Service Start Date`, Value: `2025-01-01`". It's not guessing; it's using a model specifically trained to identify these key-value pairs on a page.
    *   **Why it's a Fit**: It's purpose-built for this exact task. It's highly accurate with form data, has a clear path for HIPAA compliance (by signing a BAA with AWS), and has a mature Python SDK (`boto3`) that makes integration with Odoo straightforward.
    *   **Best For**: Getting started quickly with a powerful, dedicated form-extraction tool. This would be my **top recommendation** for your project.

2.  **Google Cloud Vision AI (Document AI)**
    *   **How it "Reads" Fields**: Google's Document AI product line has a `Form Parser`. Similar to Textract, it's a specialized processor that you use instead of their generic text detection. It identifies form fields and returns them as structured key-value pairs. It also excels at handling variations in document quality and layout.
    *   **Why it's a Fit**: Google's AI/ML capabilities are world-class. It offers comparable accuracy to AWS, is also HIPAA compliant, and has a well-supported Python client library.
    *   **Best For**: Projects already within the Google Cloud ecosystem or those needing to process a very wide variety of document types beyond just forms.

3.  **Azure Form Recognizer (now Azure AI Document Intelligence)**
    *   **How it "Reads" Fields**: Microsoft's offering has a "prebuilt model" for general documents that extracts key-value pairs, text, and tables. You can also train a "custom model" by providing as few as five sample documents. This custom training can yield extremely high accuracy if your Service Agreements have a relatively consistent (but not perfectly identical) structure.
    *   **Why it's a Fit**: The ability to quickly train a custom model is a powerful advantage if the prebuilt model struggles with your specific forms. It is also HIPAA compliant and integrates well with Python.
    *   **Best For**: Scenarios where you want to fine-tune the extraction model for your specific document layout to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

### Summary Comparison

| Service | How It Works | Key Advantage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AWS Textract** | `AnalyzeDocument` API with `FORMS` feature. Pre-trained on millions of forms. | **Purpose-built and straightforward.** Excellent for getting started with high accuracy out-of-the-box. |
| **Google Document AI** | `Form Parser` processor. Leverages Google's massive ML infrastructure. | **High accuracy and versatility.** Part of a very broad and powerful AI ecosystem. |
| **Azure AI Document Intelligence** | Prebuilt models, or train a **custom model** with your own documents. | **Customization.** The ability to fine-tune a model on your specific forms can lead to near-perfect extraction. |

For your use case, all three are excellent, HIPAA-compliant choices that will programmatically "read" the fields and extract the subsequent information.

I would recommend starting the **Phase 1 Proof of Concept** with **AWS Textract** due to its focused functionality and ease of use for this specific form-extraction task. We can prove the concept quickly and then be confident in building the full Odoo module around it.

_**Assistant (gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing the Choice**

I'm beginning to see the rationale behind the user's decision. Leveraging Azure AI Document Intelligence, given their existing SharePoint infrastructure, is definitely a sensible approach. Now, I need to articulate how those two components would integrate seamlessly.


**Justifying the Workflow**

I'm now outlining the integration, confirming the workflow's continuity despite the backend change. Specifically, I will explain how Azure AI Document Intelligence slots into the established process, focusing on both prebuilt and custom model options for maximum flexibility.


**Mapping the Integration**

I'm now focusing on the specifics of the Azure integration. I'm confirming that the workflow remains largely unchanged, highlighting Azure AI Document Intelligence as the core component. I'm laying out two model options: prebuilt and custom, and detailing the significant advantages of the custom model for higher accuracy with their unique document layouts.


**Elaborating Azure Implementation**

I'm now dissecting the Azure-specific details. I'm confirming the workflow's continued function while highlighting Azure AI Document Intelligence's role, and re-emphasizing prebuilt vs. custom models. I'm also focusing on the advantages of training a custom model, a key selling point. I'm now outlining a Proof of Concept, from sample PDF gathering to model training in the Azure AI Document Intelligence Studio. The plan also includes a simple Python script using the Azure AI client library. Finally, I will be addressing the SharePoint connection and proposing a manual upload approach initially, with automated integration as a future phase.


</details></think>

---

That's a very logical connection to make. If your organization is already invested in the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, using **Azure AI Document Intelligence** is an excellent choice. It simplifies procurement, billing, and identity management since you can likely use your existing Azure Active Directory credentials.

The overall architecture and phased plan we discussed remain exactly the same. We would simply be swapping out the API calls to AWS for API calls to Azure.

### How We'll Use Azure AI Document Intelligence

Azure gives us two great options, and we can test both easily in the Proof of Concept phase:

1.  **Start with the `prebuilt-document` Model**: This is the general-purpose, out-of-the-box model. It's trained to extract key-value pairs, text, and tables from a wide variety of documents. We would start here because it's the fastest path to a result. We can get an idea of its baseline accuracy in a matter of hours.

2.  **Elevate Accuracy with a "Custom Extraction Model"**: This is Azure's key advantage for your use case. If the prebuilt model is, say, 85% accurate, we can significantly improve it. The process is straightforward:
    *   We take 5 to 10 sample Service Agreement PDFs from your SharePoint.
    *   We upload them to the Azure AI Studio (a web-based tool).
    *   In the Studio, we visually "tag" or "label" the fields on the documents. For example, we'd draw a box around "2025-01-01" and label it as `StartDate`.
    *   We click "Train," and Azure creates a new AI model that is specifically fine-tuned to understand the unique layout and terminology of *your* Service Agreements.

Using a custom model often pushes accuracy above 95%, which would dramatically reduce the amount of manual correction needed by your administrators, saving time and money.

### Revised Proof of Concept Plan (Using Azure)

Here is the updated plan for our **Phase 1: Proof of Concept (~1-2 weeks)**:

1.  **Setup**: Create an Azure AI Document Intelligence resource in your Azure portal.
2.  **Gather Samples**: Collect 5-10 representative Service Agreement PDFs from SharePoint.
3.  **Initial Test (No Code)**: Use the Azure AI Studio's web interface to test the `prebuilt-document` model with one of your sample PDFs. We'll see the extracted key-value pairs instantly.
4.  **Custom Model Training (No Code)**: Still within the Studio, create a new custom model project and train it using your sample PDFs. This will give us a highly accurate model to use in our application.
5.  **Python Script**: Write a Python script using Azure's client library to programmatically upload a PDF and get the structured data back from our new custom model. This script will be the foundation for the Odoo integration.

This approach leverages your existing infrastructure and gives us a clear path to achieving the highest possible accuracy for the OCR extraction.

Does this Azure-centric plan sound good to you? We can start by outlining the first steps for the Proof of Concept.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Azure AI Setup**

I'm starting to outline the guide's structure, focusing on the initial setup. Prerequisites are key, and I'm considering what the user needs before starting. Currently, I'm focusing on the necessary Azure resources and access rights.


**Planning the Document Guide**

I'm now fleshing out the specific steps for connecting SharePoint to Azure AI Document Intelligence. Power Automate will be the orchestrator, so I'll outline creating a flow. This involves a trigger (file creation in SharePoint), getting the file content, calling the Document Intelligence API, handling the response, and then what to do with the extracted data (perhaps a SharePoint list).


**Structuring the Guide Outline**

I'm now solidifying the detailed steps, and thinking about the user persona: a business analyst or architect, so I'll focus on the low-code approach. I'll structure the steps as a numbered list, emphasizing the Power Automate flow's setup: trigger, file retrieval, AI API call, response handling, and data storage, most likely into a SharePoint list. I'll offer an alternative, Azure Logic Apps/Function Apps, for the developers.


**Outlining the Guide Details**

I'm now breaking down the core of the guide. The primary audience being business analysts means Power Automate is the focus, so I'm honing the flow steps. I'll include detailed instructions for creating a SharePoint list to store extracted data, which would give the user a tangible outcome. The guide's structure is evolving.


**Detailing Power Automate Steps**

I'm now focusing on the Power Automate flow steps. It will start with a SharePoint trigger. Then, I will get the file content. I'm planning to detail calling the Azure AI Document Intelligence API using the connector. Also, I will cover the response handling and storing the extracted data into a SharePoint list for a tangible outcome. I believe the numbered lists are going to be clear.

Of course. This is a fantastic side quest and a perfect real-world workflow.

Connecting SharePoint to Azure AI Document Intelligence is a classic automation task within the Microsoft ecosystem. The best tool for the job is **Power Automate** (formerly known as Microsoft Flow), which is part of your Microsoft 365 subscription. It allows you to create workflows that connect different apps and services with little to no code.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can set this up.

### Goal: Create a workflow that automatically triggers when a new Service Agreement PDF is added to a SharePoint folder, sends it to Azure AI for analysis, and stores the extracted data in a SharePoint List.

---

### Step 1: Prepare Your SharePoint Environment

1.  **Create a Document Library Folder**: In your SharePoint site, create a new folder where users will upload the Service Agreement PDFs. For example: `Documents > ServiceAgreements > ToBeProcessed`.
2.  **Create a SharePoint List**: This list will be our "database" to store the extracted data. Create a new SharePoint List named `Extracted Agreements`. Add columns to this list that match the fields you need from the PDF, based on the `mnits_service_agreement_v1.spec.md`.
    *   `Title` (comes by default, you can use it for the filename)
    *   `ServiceAgreementID` (Single line of text)
    *   `ClientID` (Single line of text)
    *   `ServiceCode` (Single line of text)
    *   `StartDate` (Date and time)
    *   `EndDate` (Date and time)
    *   `AuthorizedUnits` (Number)
    *   *...and so on for the other fields.*

### Step 2: Set Up Azure AI Document Intelligence

As we discussed, you'll need the Azure resource ready.

1.  **Create the Resource**: Go to the Azure Portal and create a "Document Intelligence" resource.
2.  **Train a Custom Model (Recommended)**: Follow the steps we discussed previously to train a custom model using 5-10 sample PDFs in the **Document Intelligence Studio**. This will give you a unique `Model ID`.
3.  **Get Your Keys**: From your resource in the Azure Portal, go to the "Keys and Endpoint" section. You will need three pieces of information for Power Automate:
    *   **Endpoint URL**
    *   **API Key**
    *   **Your Custom Model ID** (from the training step)

### Step 3: Build the Workflow in Power Automate

This is where we connect everything.

1.  **Go to Power Automate**: Open the Power Automate web app from your Microsoft 365 portal.
2.  **Create a New Flow**:
    *   Click `Create` on the left-hand side.
    *   Select `Automated cloud flow`.
    *   Give your flow a name, like `Process New Service Agreements`.
    *   For the trigger, search for "SharePoint" and select the trigger: **`When a file is created in a folder`**.
    *   Click `Create`.

3.  **Configure the Trigger**:
    *   **Site Address**: Select your SharePoint site.
    *   **Folder ID**: Navigate to and select the `ToBeProcessed` folder you created in Step 1.

4.  **Add the Azure AI Action**:
    *   Click `+ New step`.
    *   Search for "Azure AI Document Intelligence" and select the action: **`Analyze document from file`**.
    *   You will be asked to create a connection. Give it a name and paste in the **Endpoint URL** and **API Key** from Azure.
    *   In the action's configuration:
        *   **File Content**: Select `File Content` from the dynamic content box (this is the actual PDF file from the SharePoint trigger).
        *   **Model ID**: Enter the **Custom Model ID** you got from the Document Intelligence Studio.

5.  **Add the SharePoint "Create Item" Action**:
    *   Click `+ New step`.
    *   Search for "SharePoint" and select the action: **`Create item`**.
    *   Configure the action:
        *   **Site Address**: Select your SharePoint site.
        *   **List Name**: Select the `Extracted Agreements` list you created.
    *   Now, you will see all the columns from your SharePoint list. This is where the magic happens. Click into a field (e.g., `ServiceAgreementID`) and the dynamic content box will appear. You will see all the fields that Azure AI Document Intelligence extracted.
    *   Match the dynamic content fields from the "Analyze document" step to the columns in your SharePoint list. For example:
        *   `ServiceAgreementID` -> `ServiceAgreementID value`
        *   `ClientID` -> `ClientID value`
        *   `StartDate` -> `StartDate value`
        *   *(And so on for all fields)*

### Step 4: Test Your Flow

1.  **Save** your flow in the top-right corner.
2.  **Test** the flow by choosing the "Manually" test option.
3.  **Upload a PDF**: In another window, go to your SharePoint `ToBeProcessed` folder and upload a new Service Agreement PDF.
4.  **Watch it Run**: Go back to Power Automate. The flow will trigger and you can watch it run step-by-step. If it succeeds, a new item will appear in your `Extracted Agreements` SharePoint list with the data neatly organized in the columns.

This low-code approach is perfect for building out the initial PoC and even for a production workflow. The entire process is now automated: a user simply drags and drops a PDF into a folder, and a few moments later, the structured data appears in a SharePoint list, ready for review or further processing.
