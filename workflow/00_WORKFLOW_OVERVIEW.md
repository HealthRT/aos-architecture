## üéØ **VISUAL SUMMARY: THE MASTER WORKFLOW**

The following diagram illustrates our complete, end-to-end process, from initial idea to production deployment. Each phase is detailed in its own document within this directory.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 1: Ideation"
        A[1. Human defines need] --> B[2. BA creates Feature Brief];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 2: Specification"
        B --> C[3. BA creates YAML Spec] --> D{4. Architect Reviews};
    end
    subgraph "Phase 3: Decomposition"
        D -- Approved --> E[5. Scrum Master creates Work Orders];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 4: Implementation"
        E --> F[6. Coder implements & tests];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 5: Validation"
        F --> G[7. CI/CD & Human Review];
    end
    subgraph "Phase 6: Deployment"
        G -- Merged --> H[8. Deploy & UAT];
    end

## üèõÔ∏è **GOVERNANCE: THE IMMUTABLE CORE**

Our entire process is governed by **ADR-009: Immutable Core Framework**. This separates artifacts into three rings of authority:

1.  **Ring 0: The Immutable Core (`/prompts/core/`)**
    -   **What:** The "constitution" of the project (`00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`).
    -   **Who Can Change:** Human overseer only.

2.  **Ring 1: The Protected Layer (`/standards`, `/prompts`, `/templates`, `/decisions`)**
    -   **What:** Our operational standards, agent primers, and ADRs.
    -   **Who Can Change:** Executive Architect proposes ‚Üí Human overseer approves via PR.

3.  **Ring 2: The Adaptive Layer (`/process_improvement`, GitHub Issues)**
    -   **What:** Feedback, logs, and discussions.
    -   **Who Can Change:** All agents contribute.
