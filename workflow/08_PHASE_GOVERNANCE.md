# 08: Phase 8 - Governance & Process Improvement

**Purpose:** To provide a formal, managed, and data-driven loop for the continuous improvement of our agentic development workflow. This entire phase is governed by **ADR-008: Systemic Process Improvement**.

---

### Process Flow

1.  **Trigger (Feedback Generation):** At the end of every implementation task, the Coder Agent is required to provide structured "Process Improvement Feedback" as a comment on its Work Order issue.
2.  **Logging:** The Executive Architect is responsible for reviewing this raw feedback and logging any significant, non-duplicate insights into the central `process_improvement/process-improvement.md` log.
3.  **Trend Analysis:** On a periodic basis (e.g., weekly), the Executive Architect analyzes the log for recurring patterns of inefficiency, ambiguity, or failure.
4.  **Change Proposal Process:** If a clear trend is identified, the Architect will propose a change to our "Protected Layer" (standards, prompts, or templates). This proposal is made via a **Pull Request**.
    a. The Architect creates a new branch in the `aos-architecture` repository.
    b. The Architect modifies or creates the relevant standard/template file.
    c. The Architect opens a Pull Request. The body of the PR is the formal proposal and **must contain the justification** for the change, citing the specific entries from the process improvement log as evidence.
5.  **Human-in-the-Loop Approval:** The Architect assigns the PR to the human overseer (`@james-healthrt`) for final review. The human overseer has the ultimate authority to approve or reject the proposed process change by **merging or closing the PR**.

### Entry Criteria
- An AI agent provides structured feedback.

### Exit Criteria
- The feedback is logged.
- If a trend is identified and a change is proposed, the resulting PR is either merged or closed by the human overseer.
