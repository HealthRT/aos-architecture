## Entry #001 - Downstream Feedback (Coder Performance)

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Issue:** [Hub #2 - Code Hygiene Refactor](https://github.com/HealthRT/hub/issues/2)  
**Agent Type:** [First AI Coder - Type/Model Not Documented]  
**Feedback Source:** Reviewer (via code review)  
**Loop Type:** Downstream (Implementation Quality)

### Summary
First AI Coder Agent assigned to Issue #2 (code hygiene refactor) completed partial work but failed to meet Definition of Done requirements. Work required handoff to second agent for completion.

### Specific Issues Identified

1. **Missing Deliverable**
   - `tests/__init__.py` imported `test_meeting_service` but file was never created or committed
   - Violates "completeness" requirement

2. **Scope Creep / Unnecessary Changes**
   - Added external dependencies (`requests`, `beautifulsoup4`) to `__manifest__.py`
   - Dependencies were not used anywhere in module
   - Not requested in work order
   - Contradicts issue goal of "removing dead code"

3. **No Proof of Execution (CRITICAL)**
   - Failed to provide mandatory boot logs
   - Failed to provide test execution output
   - Violates explicit Definition of Done requirement #4

### Root Cause Analysis

**Possible Contributing Factors:**
- Agent may not have been properly briefed on "Proof of Execution" mandate
- Work order may not have emphasized non-negotiable nature of DoD checklist
- Agent type/model may not be well-suited for refactoring tasks requiring thoroughness
- No automated validation that DoD was completed before marking issue complete

### Impact Metrics

- **Discovery Tax:** 30+ minutes spent reviewing incomplete work
- **First-Pass Quality:** FAILED (0% of acceptance criteria fully met)
- **Workflow Friction:** Moderate - required agent handoff and re-briefing
- **Rework Required:** ~2-3 hours estimated for second agent to complete

### Recommendations for Process Improvement

1. **Enforce Proof of Execution More Explicitly**
   - Consider making it a required GitHub Issue template field
   - Add to coder agent onboarding as "CRITICAL: NON-NEGOTIABLE"
   - Create automated check: PR cannot be created until proof-of-execution comment exists

2. **Agent Type Selection Guidance Needed**
   - Document which agent types/models are best for which task types
   - Refactoring tasks may require different agent profile than greenfield development

3. **Work Order Template Enhancement**
   - Add explicit "OUT OF SCOPE" section to prevent scope creep
   - Add "MANDATORY DELIVERABLES" checklist separate from acceptance criteria

4. **Automated Validation**
   - Consider GitHub Action that checks for proof-of-execution comment before allowing PR creation
   - Add label `status:needs-proof-of-execution` that blocks PR creation

### Recovery Action Taken

- Created detailed handoff prompt for second agent
- Documented acceptable vs. problematic changes
- Second agent dispatched with explicit focus on 3 critical fixes
