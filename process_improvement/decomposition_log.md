# Decomposition Pattern Validation Log

**Created:** 2025-10-12  
**Purpose:** Track work order decomposition patterns to validate Scrum Master guidance (Section 3.1)  
**Related:** `sessions/2025-10-12/DECOMPOSITION_VALIDATION_STRATEGY.md`

---

## Metrics Tracked

- **Pattern:** A (Vertical Slice), B (Layer-by-Layer), C (Other/Hybrid)
- **LOC:** Lines of code (estimated at WO creation, actual at completion)
- **Components:** Model, Security, Views, Controllers, Tests, etc.
- **Bootable?:** Yes (first try), Rework (after fixes), No (failed)
- **Rework Cycles:** Number of times agent had to revise for bootability/missing deps
- **Agent Feedback:** Coder's assessment of WO quality and clarity

---

## Validation Phases

### **Phase 1 (WO-001 to WO-005): Adherence & Bootability**
**Goal:** Test if patterns are followed and produce bootable code  
**Success:** > 90% bootable, < 0.5 rework cycles per WO

### **Phase 2 (WO-006 to WO-010): Pattern Comparison**
**Goal:** A/B test Pattern A vs. Pattern B  
**Success:** Identify which pattern has better outcomes

### **Phase 3 (WO-011 to WO-015): Sizing Validation**
**Goal:** Validate LOC sizing guidelines  
**Success:** Optimal LOC ranges identified

## Log

| WO ID | Date | Pattern | Est. LOC | Actual LOC | Components | Bootable? | Rework | Agent Feedback | Notes |
|-------|------|---------|----------|------------|------------|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| WO-AGMT-001-01 | 2025-10-09 | A (Vertical) | ~300 | ~250 | Model+Sec+Views+Tests | Yes | 1 | Security CSV issue (Entry #007) | Pre-guidance baseline |
| WO-AGMT-001-02 | 2025-10-09 | A (Vertical) | ~150 | TBD | Partner extension | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pre-guidance baseline |
| WO-AGMT-001-03 | 2025-10-09 | A (Vertical) | ~200 | TBD | Workflow + logic | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pre-guidance baseline |
| WO-AGMT-001-04 | 2025-10-09 | A (Vertical) | ~250 | TBD | Form views | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pre-guidance baseline |
| WO-AGMT-001-05 | 2025-10-09 | A (Vertical) | ~100 | TBD | Access rules | TBD | TBD | TBD | Pre-guidance baseline |

## Retrospective Schedule

- **After WO-005:** Phase 1 retrospective (adherence & bootability)
- **After WO-010:** Phase 2 retrospective (pattern comparison)
- **After WO-015:** Phase 3 retrospective (sizing validation)
- **Quarterly:** Full decomposition pattern review

---

## Decision Thresholds

### **Green (Keep Current Guidance):**
- ✅ Bootability > 90%
- ✅ Agent satisfaction > 80%
- ✅ Rework < 0.5 per WO

### **Yellow (Monitor):**
- ⚠️ Bootability 75-90%
- ⚠️ Satisfaction 60-80%
- ⚠️ Rework 0.5-1.0 per WO

### **Red (Revise Immediately):**
- ❌ Bootability < 75%
- ❌ Satisfaction < 60%
- ❌ Rework > 1.0 per WO

## Notes

- **Baseline Data:** WO-AGMT-001-01 through 05 were created BEFORE Section 3.1 guidance existed
- **First Post-Guidance WO:** TBD (will be first WO created after Scrum Master reads updated primer)
- **Data Source:** Agent feedback entries in `process-improvement.md`, proof of execution logs, work order GitHub Issues
