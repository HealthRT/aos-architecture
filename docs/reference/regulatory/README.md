### Version Control
Regulations change over time. When a new version is released:
1. Rename old version: `document-name-v2023.pdf`
2. Add new version: `document-name-v2024.pdf` or use unversioned `document-name.pdf` for latest
3. Keep both versions (audit trail)
4. Update references in ADRs

### Effective Dates
Always note the effective date of regulations:
- Compliance requirements may vary by date
- System behavior may need to match regulation version at time of service
- Audits require showing "what rules applied when"
