## üîÑ Maintenance Procedures

### Adding a New Document

1. **Determine Category:**
   - Regulatory? ‚Üí `regulatory/[agency]/`
   - API? ‚Üí `api-specs/[vendor]/`
   - Validation? ‚Üí `validation-rules/[domain]/`

2. **Add File:**
   - Place in appropriate subdirectory
   - Follow naming conventions
   - Redact PHI if sample document

3. **Update Documentation:**
   - Add entry to this INDEX.md (Quick Reference section)
   - Update subdirectory README.md
   - Note status: *Available* or *Pending*

4. **Cross-Reference:**
   - Update relevant ADRs if decision based on this document
   - Add to feature REFERENCES.md if feature-specific

5. **Version Control:**
   - Commit with descriptive message: `docs: add DHS waiver program manual v2024`
   - Note effective date in commit message

### Updating an Existing Document

1. **Keep Old Version:**
   - Rename old version: `document-name-v2023.pdf`
   - Add new version: `document-name.pdf` (latest is always unversioned)
   - Or use subdirectory: `document-name/v2024.pdf`

2. **Update References:**
   - Update INDEX.md with new version date
   - Check ADRs for references to old version
   - Notify team of changes via changelog

3. **Rationale:**
   - Regulatory compliance may require referencing historical versions
   - Audit trail for "what did we know when we made that decision?"
