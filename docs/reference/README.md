# Reference Documentation Library

This directory contains external reference materials that inform AOS architectural decisions, feature specifications, and compliance requirements.

---

## üìö What Goes Here

This library is for **external** documents that:
- Come from government agencies, regulatory bodies, or third-party vendors
- Inform architectural decisions (cite in ADRs)
- Define business rules we must implement
- Provide compliance requirements we must meet
- Specify external APIs we integrate with

**This is NOT for:**
- Internal specifications (those go in `/specs`)
- Feature briefs (those go in `/features`)
- ADRs (those go in `/decisions`)
- Work orders (those go in `/work_orders`)

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Organization

Documents are organized by **type**, not by feature:

```
reference/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ regulatory/          # Government regulations & compliance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-specs/           # External API documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ validation-rules/    # Business logic from external sources
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ INDEX.md             # Master index (START HERE)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Guidelines

### PHI Protection
**NEVER upload documents with real Protected Health Information.**

Before uploading any sample document:
- [ ] Remove patient names, addresses, dates of birth
- [ ] Remove provider identification (unless public)
- [ ] Remove specific dates (use placeholders like "XX/XX/XXXX")
- [ ] Replace with generic values (e.g., "John Doe", "Sample Agency")
- [ ] Note redactions in subdirectory README

### Copyright & Licensing
- Government documents ‚Üí Generally public domain (safe to include)
- Vendor API docs ‚Üí Check license terms
- Third-party materials ‚Üí May require permission
- Note copyright status in subdirectory README

### Version Control
- Keep historical versions (regulations change over time)
- Name files with version/year when applicable
- Document version in subdirectory README
- Commit messages should note version: `docs: add DHS manual v2024`
