summary: |
  Deliver Level 10 meeting capability following the EOS agenda order, without timers in MVP.
  Meetings are weekly for two groups: Executive Leadership and Management (Designated Coordinators).
  MVP includes linking to canonical items (issues, rocks, to-dos, scorecards) via a meeting-item junction model.
assumptions:
  - One company tenant for MVP; future multi-team scale planned
  - No timers required for sections in MVP
  - EOS agenda order is required and enforced as sequence (not timeboxed)
  - Only Facilitator role is required for MVP (others can be added later)
non_goals:
  - Clinical/EVV workflows
  - PHI storage/processing
  - Cross-company meetings
requirements:
  functional:
    - Create, schedule, and run a weekly Level 10 meeting for each group
    - Enforce EOS section order; allow navigation forward/backward
    - Add/view notes per section; capture completion of meeting
    - Attach/link existing canonical items (issue/rock/todo/scorecard metric) to a meeting
    - Create action items (to-dos) during a meeting
    - Escalate/cascade linked items between groups with history preserved
    - Emit internal events on meeting completion for downstream notifications (future)
  nonfunctional:
    - Follow ADR-003 (API-first), ADR-006 (multi-tenancy ready), ADR-007 (modular independence)
    - Tests per "standards/08-testing-requirements.md" with zero failures
    - Role and record rules to ensure only intended groups can read/write meeting data
agenda:
  order:
    - segue
    - scorecard
    - rocks_review
    - customer_employee_headlines
    - to_do_list
    - IDS
    - conclude
  notes: EOS names can be adjusted to Odoo-safe identifiers; UX uses EOS labels
organizational_scope:
  groups:
    - executive_leadership
    - management
  recurrence: weekly
linking_model:
  name: traction.meeting_item_link
  purpose: Per-meeting context for linked items without duplicating canonical records
  fields:
    - meeting_id (many2one traction.meeting)
    - item_model (selection: issue|rock|todo|scorecard_kpi)
    - item_id (many2one dynamic)
    - section (selection matching agenda order)
    - status_at_meeting (char/selection)
    - assignee_at_meeting (many2one res.users)
    - notes_snapshot (text)
    - escalated_from (many2one traction.group)
    - escalated_to (many2one traction.group)
    - carried_over_from (many2one traction.meeting)
acceptance_criteria:
  - Can create and complete a Level 10 meeting for each group
  - EOS agenda order enforced; navigation persists section notes
  - Items can be linked to agenda sections; links maintain per-meeting context
  - Escalation creates a link in the destination group while preserving history
  - Tests cover happy path, edge cases (no items, missing context), and error conditions
test_plan:
  - Unit tests for meeting create/run/complete
  - Unit tests for linking model and escalation behavior
  - Record rule tests for facilitator access
deliverables:
  - Approved data model and service contracts
  - Work orders to implement models, linking, ACLs, and tests
