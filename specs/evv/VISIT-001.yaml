title: "Create Core Visit Record & Capture Service Selection"
summary: "Enables a DSP to clock-in for a visit, capturing the specific service being performed, and creates the foundational visit record."

# --- User Story (for human context) ---
user_story: "As a Direct Support Professional (DSP), I want to select the specific service I am providing at clock-in, so that the system can accurately track the delivery of authorized services."

# --- Business Logic & Validation ---
rules:
  - q: "What service validation happens at clock-in for MVP?"
    a: "For MVP, the backend validation is simple: it checks if the patient has AT LEAST ONE active service agreement. Per stakeholder direction, it does NOT yet validate against the specific service selected by the DSP. The service_agreement_id is captured for future use but is not used in the back-end validation logic for MVP."
  - q: "What happens if the DSP's device is offline?"
    a: "For MVP, the PWA requires a live internet connection to perform clock-in and clock-out. The action must fail with a clear error message if the device is offline. Offline support is a post-MVP requirement."

# --- Testing & Verification ---
acceptance_criteria:
  - "GIVEN a patient has two different active service agreements ('In-Home Support' and 'Respite Care'), WHEN a DSP initiates clock-in for that patient on the PWA, THEN the PWA must display both service options and require the DSP to select one before proceeding."
  - "GIVEN a DSP selects 'In-Home Support' and completes the clock-in, WHEN the visit record is created, THEN the `service_agreement_id` field on the `evv.visit` record must be correctly populated with the 'In-Home Support' service line record."
  - "GIVEN the DSP's device has location services enabled, WHEN the DSP clocks in, THEN the system must capture and store their GPS coordinates in the `clock_in_location` field."
  - "GIVEN the DSP's device has location services enabled, WHEN the DSP clocks out, THEN the system must capture and store their GPS coordinates in the `clock_out_location` field."
  - "GIVEN a patient has no active service agreements, WHEN a DSP initiates clock-in for that patient, THEN the system must block the clock-in and display an error message stating that no authorized services are available."
  - "GIVEN a DSP's device has no internet connectivity, WHEN they attempt to clock-in, THEN the PWA must display an error message (e.g., 'A network connection is required') and must not create a visit record."

# --- Agent Guidance ---
agent_hints:
  builder_output: "Create the new evv.visit model. The service selection logic is primarily a PWA/frontend concern, but the backend must expose an endpoint that returns a list of active service agreements for a given patient."
  qa_output: "Generate tests that confirm the visit record is created with the correct links and that the clock-in block for patients with no active agreements works as expected."
  security_focus: "Ensure access controls are strictly enforced. A DSP must only be able to create/read/write their own visits. A DC should only have access to the visits of the DSPs they are assigned to."
