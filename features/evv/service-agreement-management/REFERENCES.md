## üîó Related Architecture Decisions

### ADRs Influenced by Reference Documents

#### Directly Referenced
- **ADR-003:** API-First Design
  - Service agreement data will be exposed via API for validation engine
  
- **ADR-006:** Multi-Tenancy Strategy
  - Service agreements are tenant-specific (per agency)
  - Future: Multiple counties may have different authorization rules

#### Indirectly Related
- **ADR-002:** Environment Configuration
  - External system IDs (agreement numbers, recipient IDs) handled securely
  
- **ADR-007:** Modular Independence
  - Service agreement module can function independently
  - Validation engine will be separate module

## üìã Open Questions for SMEs

Reference document gaps that need SME input:

**OI-002:** Are procedure code modifiers always required?
- Sample shows all lines have modifiers
- Need confirmation: Can authorization exist without modifiers?
- **Reference needed:** Official guidance on procedure code requirements

**OI-003:** Is diagnosis code required for all authorizations?
- Sample shows ICD-10 code present
- Need confirmation: Required always, or only for specific service types?
- **Reference needed:** DHS documentation requirements

**OI-004:** Is rate per unit always provided upfront?
- Sample shows rates on all lines
- Need confirmation: Can authorization be created without rate?
- **Reference needed:** County authorization process documentation

**See:** `../../specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items.md` for complete list
