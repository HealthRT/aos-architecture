# Feature Suite Brief: Employee Experience

**Status:** Proposed
**Author:** Executive Architect
**Date:** 2025-10-07

## 1. Vision & Strategy

This document outlines the architectural vision for the **Employee Experience (IF) Suite**, a collection of interconnected modules designed to operationalize an AI-driven recruiting, engagement, and retention framework within the Hub.

The core purpose is to create a semi-intelligent, human-centered employee experience where AI operates behind the scenes to analyze behavioral signals, surface insights, and prompt managers to take authentic, human actions (e.g., recognition, support). The system should feel manager-led, not machine-led.

Development will be phased, starting with foundational modules (`if_hr_core_ext`, `if_signals`) and iteratively building out more advanced capabilities like the ML bridge and nudge engine.

## 2. Architectural Principles

-   **Hub-Centric:** The entire suite is an administrative, non-HIPAA function and will reside exclusively in the **Hub**.
-   **Signal-Driven:** The system is built around a central, append-only event log (`if_signals`) that captures all relevant behavioral and system data.
-   **API-First:** All modules must be built according to **ADR-003**, with clean internal APIs to ensure they can emit signals and be programmatically accessed.
-   **Modular Design:** The suite is broken into discrete Odoo modules to allow for phased development, independent testing, and maintainability.

## 3. Core Functional Modules

The suite consists of the following conceptual modules:

1.  **`if_hr_core_ext`:** Extends the core `hr.employee` model.
2.  **`if_recognition`:** Peer-to-peer and manager-to-employee recognition.
3.  **`if_gamification_ext`:** Enhances Odoo's gamification with missions, streaks, etc.
4.  **`if_signals`:** The foundational, append-only event log for all behavioral data.
5.  **`if_ml_bridge`:** The interface to ML services for analyzing signals and generating engagement profiles.
6.  **`if_nudges`:** A rules engine to convert ML insights into actionable manager prompts.
7.  **`if_manager_assistant`:** The manager-facing UI for insights and guided conversations. This will be integrated into the "Ask IF" AI Assistant.
8.  **`if_privacy_consent`:** A dedicated module for privacy, consent, and data governance.
9.  **`if_integrations_*`:** A series of modules for connecting to external systems like Slack, ATS, and LMS to gather more signals.
10. **`if_analytics_hub`:** Aggregated, non-PII reporting dashboards.

## 4. Key Cross-System Interactions

-   **EVV to Hub Signal Emission:** This suite's effectiveness depends on receiving behavioral signals from the EVV. A new API endpoint, `POST /api/v1/signals`, has been created for this purpose, governed by a forthcoming ADR.
-   **Integration with "Ask IF":** The `if_manager_assistant` functionality will be implemented as a new "tool" within the "Ask IF" module's Agentic architecture, providing managers with a natural language interface to team insights.
-   **Integration with `traction_EOS_odoo`:** The recognition and gamification modules should be built to extend or integrate with the existing Traction module.
