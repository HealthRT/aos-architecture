# Executive Summary for 2025-10-13

Today was a day of significant forward progress punctuated by the discovery and correction of critical systemic process failures. We successfully completed and merged two major, multi-work-order features (`AGMT-001` and the `TRACTION` MVP). However, the path to completion revealed deep-seated issues in agent verification and knowledge transfer.

In response, we have battle-hardened our core documentation—specifically agent onboarding and work order templates—to build an "immune system" against the specific failure patterns we observed. We end the day with more robust features and a significantly more resilient process.

## Key Accomplishments (Features Completed)

-   **Wave 3 Started: `evv_agreements` Refactored & Merged:** After a complex recovery from a process error, the agent's correct, high-quality implementation of the refactored Service Agreement model was approved and merged into `main`.
-   **Hub Feature Complete: Traction/EOS MVP Approved:** The full suite of work for the Traction MVP (`TRACTION-001` through `008`) passed architectural review and is now considered complete. The agent successfully remediated the initial security flaw and applied the learning across all subsequent modules.
-   **Workflow Gap Addressed: UAT Environment Tooling (`SYSTEM-004`):** Based on your feedback, we formally specified and scheduled the work to create dedicated `start-uat-env.sh` and `stop-uat-env.sh` scripts, which will provide you with a stable, persistent environment for manual testing.

## Major Challenges & Resolutions

-   **`AGMT-001` False Failure and Recovery:** My architectural review initially **failed** `AGMT-001` due to a critical regression. A subsequent investigation by the Scrum Master proved that my review was based on **incorrect code** that had been accidentally reverted during a previous incident. We successfully recovered the agent's original, correct work and the final review **passed**.
-   **`TRACTION` Repeated Failure Pattern:** The `TRACTION` MVP repeated the exact same "missing security groups" failure as `PT-001`. This was identified as a systemic failure of knowledge transfer between agents. We resolved this by forcing the same agent to fix its own mistake, which created a strong learning signal and resulted in a final, successful implementation.

## Process Improvements Implemented

Based on the review of the `process-improvement.md` log, we took the following actions today:
1.  **Hardened Coder Onboarding:** The `onboarding_coder_agent.md` was significantly updated with a mandatory **"Security First" workflow**, a critical **"Immutable Tooling" policy**, and explicit instructions for agents to manually verify their test results.
2.  **Reinforced Work Orders:** The `work_order_template.md` was updated to include the "Immutable Tooling" warning directly, ensuring it is visible in every task.

## Current Status

-   **EVV Repository:** All Wave 1 and Wave 2 modules are merged. The first major piece of Wave 3 (`AGMT-001`) is also merged. The next logical step is to begin QA on `AGMT-001` and then proceed to the `VISIT-001` specification. The new tooling work (`SYSTEM-004`) is ready for the Scrum Master to dispatch.
-   **Hub Repository:** The Traction MVP is functionally complete and merged.

We are at a clean and stable checkpoint across the entire project.
