**After:** 28 fields, production-ready data model

**Key Changes:**
- Extended `res.partner` with contact classification (`is_patient`, `is_case_manager`, external IDs)
- Changed case manager from text fields to Many2one relationship (prevents duplicates)
- Added complete financial fields (rate_per_unit, total_amount computed)
- Added comprehensive compliance fields (diagnosis_code, case manager relationship)
- Documented 12 business rules
- Created 22 detailed acceptance criteria

**Field Groups:**
- Agreement Header & Traceability (4 fields)
- Patient/Recipient Info (2 fields)
- Service Specification (7 fields)
- Dates (4 fields: effective_date, through_date + computed aliases)
- Authorization Quantities (1 field)
- Financial (3 fields including computed total_amount)
- Compliance (2 fields)
- State Management (1 field)

**Models Affected:**
- `res.partner` (extended with 4 new fields)
- `service.agreement` (24 fields)

**Files Updated:**
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001.yaml` - Complete specification
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items.md` - SME questions (6 items)
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items-pdf-guide.md` - SME distribution guide

### **2. Work Order Generation & Quality Control**

**Generated:** 5 work orders by Scrum Master Agent  
**Quality Issue Detected:** "Tests optional" phrase found despite explicit prohibition  
**Resolution:** Manual correction of all 5 work orders

**Work Orders Created:**
1. **WO-AGMT-001-01:** Bootstrap module & core models (res.partner + service.agreement)
2. **WO-AGMT-001-02:** Build UI views & actions
3. **WO-AGMT-001-03:** Configure security & access control
4. **WO-AGMT-001-04:** Implement automated tests
5. **WO-AGMT-001-05:** Author documentation

**Corrections Applied:**
- Removed "tests optional" from WO-01, WO-02, WO-03
- Added "Testing Requirements (MANDATORY)" sections with specific test cases
- Added `08-testing-requirements.md` reference to all WOs
- Fixed module labels (evv-scheduling ‚Üí evv-agreements)
- Added complete Proof of Execution commands (test/boot/upgrade)

**Files Created:**
- `work_orders/evv/AGMT-001/WO-AGMT-001-01.md` through `WO-AGMT-001-05.md`

---

### **3. Process Safeguards Implementation**

**Problem:** Second occurrence of "tests optional" despite explicit instructions  
**Root Cause:** Agent instructions not followed; pattern override from training  
**Solution:** Multi-layered safeguards

**Safeguards Implemented:**

**A. Validation Script**
- File: `scripts/validate-work-order.sh`
- Checks: 6 automated quality checks
- Usage: `./scripts/validate-work-order.sh path/to/WO-XXX.md`
- Exit codes: 0 = pass, 1 = fail
- Status: Tested and working

**B. Scrum Master Primer Update**
- File: `prompts/onboarding_scrum_master.md`
- Added: Section 4.1 "CRITICAL: Self-Check Before Submitting"
- Includes: Manual checklist + script reference
- Mandate: Must pass checks before submitting WOs

**C. Work Order Template Enhancement**
- File: `templates/work_order_template.md`
- Added: Big warning at Section 5 with prohibited phrases list
- Reinforces: Testing is NEVER optional

**D. Script Documentation**
- File: `scripts/README.md`
- Documents: Usage, integration points, maintenance

**Impact:** These safeguards apply to ALL work orders (EVV, Hub, any future system)

---

### **4. Architectural Decision: Contact Organization**

**Decision:** Use Odoo's `res.partner` model with boolean classification flags

**Implementation:**
```python
res.partner:
    is_patient = Boolean  # Identifies individuals receiving services
    is_case_manager = Boolean  # Identifies county case managers
    recipient_id_external = Char  # County patient ID (duplicate prevention)
    case_manager_external_id = Char  # County case manager ID (duplicate prevention)
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents duplicate contacts (validation by external ID)
- Enables filtered searches (show only patients, only case managers)
- Extensible pattern (future: is_employee, is_guardian, etc.)
- Standard Odoo practice

**Files Affected:**
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001.yaml` - Model definition
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items.md` - OI-005 documents future extensions

---

### **5. SME Consultation Process Established**

**Created:** Structured process for gathering SME feedback without blocking development

**Documents Created:**
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items.md` - 6 questions for SMEs
- `specs/evv/AGMT-001-open-items-pdf-guide.md` - Conversion instructions

**Open Items Documented:**
1. PHI classification for case_manager_id
2. Procedure code modifier requirements
3. Diagnosis code requirement level
4. Rate per unit requirement
5. Additional contact classification needs
6. Data entry workflow preferences

**Process:**
1. Development proceeds with reasonable defaults
2. Questions captured in structured document
3. Convert to fillable PDF for SME distribution
4. SMEs provide answers asynchronously
5. Architect creates follow-up work orders for changes

---

### **6. Hub Architect Onboarding Prepared**

**Decision:** Run EVV and Hub tracks in parallel (separate architect contexts)

**Deliverable:**
- `prompts/onboarding_architect_hub.md` - Complete Hub Architect primer
- Starting point: Traction EOS Module refactoring
- Coordination protocol: EVV Architect = "primary" for shared standards

**Benefits:**
- Parallel velocity (Hub and EVV progress simultaneously)
- Domain-specific context (each architect specializes)
- Natural separation (different repos, zero code collision)

**Collision Mitigation:**
- Hub Architect proposes shared standard updates
- EVV Architect (primary) implements
- Human overseer coordinates conflicts

---

## üìä **Metrics**

### **Documentation Created/Updated:**
- **Specifications:** 3 files (AGMT-001.yaml, open-items.md, pdf-guide.md)
- **Work Orders:** 5 files (WO-01 through WO-05)
- **Primers:** 2 files (scrum_master updated, architect_hub created)
- **Templates:** 1 file (work_order_template.md updated)
- **Scripts:** 2 files (validate-work-order.sh, scripts/README.md)
- **Total:** 13 files created/updated

### **Process Improvements:**
- **Entry #005:** Documented "tests optional" problem before it reached code
- **Safeguards:** 4 layers of protection against quality issues
- **Validation:** Automated script reduces manual review time

### **Architecture Decisions:**
- Contact organization via `res.partner` boolean flags
- Case manager as relationship (not text)
- SME consultation without blocking development
- Parallel architect contexts (EVV + Hub)

## üöß **Work In Progress (Next Session)**

### **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Map work orders to GitHub issues** (5 WOs ‚Üí determine issue structure)
2. **Update GitHub Issues #1-4** with corrected work order content
3. **Create GitHub Issue #5** (if needed for WO-05 Documentation)
4. **Apply labels** to all issues (agent:coder, type:feature, module:evv-agreements)
5. **Dispatch to Coder Agents** (assign @aos-coder-agent or @aos-tester-agent)

### **Parallel Track:**
6. **Open Hub Architect context** (brief with `onboarding_architect_hub.md`)
7. **Hub Architect reviews** Traction EOS Analysis Report
8. **Hub Architect creates** refactoring strategy
9. **Hub Architect generates** first Hub spec

### **SME Track (Non-Blocking):**
10. **Convert open-items.md to PDF** (fillable form)
11. **Distribute to SMEs** for feedback
12. **Schedule follow-up** to review answers

## üéì **Key Learnings**

### **What Worked Well:**
‚úÖ **Upstream quality control** - Caught incomplete spec before code written (saved 8-12 hours rework)  
‚úÖ **Real-world document analysis** - Using actual Service Agreement ensured completeness  
‚úÖ **Systematic correction** - Fixed all WOs before dispatch prevented cascade of issues  
‚úÖ **Automated validation** - Script catches problems humans might miss  
‚úÖ **Process documentation** - Comprehensive session summary enables seamless handoff

### **Process Improvements Validated:**
‚úÖ **"Quality multiplies upstream"** - Fixing spec prevents all downstream errors  
‚úÖ **"Shift left" principle** - Pre-dispatch review cheaper than post-implementation fixes  
‚úÖ **Agent feedback governance** - Agents log observations; architect analyzes trends; human approves changes  
‚úÖ **Immutable Core Framework** - Ring 0/1/2 governance working as designed

### **Challenges Encountered:**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Agent instruction compliance** - Explicit "NEVER" directive was ignored  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Pattern override** - Agent training biases override project-specific instructions  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Quality gate necessity** - Human/automated review required; agent self-regulation insufficient

### **Solutions Implemented:**
‚úÖ **Multi-layer safeguards** - Template warnings + primer checklists + automated validation  
‚úÖ **Self-check process** - Agent must validate own work before submission  
‚úÖ **Executable validation** - Script provides objective pass/fail criteria  
‚úÖ **Documentation reinforcement** - Multiple touchpoints for critical requirements
