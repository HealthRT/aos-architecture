# Agent Onboarding Consolidation Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-12  
**Related:** Process Improvement Entry #009, ADR-013, ADR-014, ADR-015  
**Status:** Complete

---

## 🎯 **Problem Statement**

You identified three critical gaps:

1. **Work Order Bootability:** Scrum Master had no guidance on Odoo-specific decomposition patterns. Risk: Creating work orders that produce non-bootable code (e.g., models without security).

2. **Onboarding Complexity:** Multiple documents (primers, checklists, Ring 0, ADRs) with no clear single entry point. You wanted **ONE document per agent role**.

3. **Parallel Work Infrastructure:** Agents working in parallel needed isolated Odoo instances but no infrastructure existed yet. Risk: Accidental collisions before infrastructure ready.

---

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Scrum Master Primer Enhanced**

**File:** `prompts/onboarding_scrum_master.md`

**Added Section 3.1: Odoo-Aware Decomposition Patterns**

**Key Additions:**

- **Bootability Principle:** Every work order MUST result in code that boots Odoo without errors
- **Minimal Bootable Odoo Module:** `__manifest__.py` + `__init__.py` + at least one component
- **Security CSV Rule:** If work order creates models, it MUST include `security/ir.model.access.csv` or Odoo install fails

**Two Decomposition Patterns:**

| Pattern | Description | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| **Pattern A: Vertical Slice** | Complete end-to-end functionality per WO | PREFERRED - Each slice is independently bootable |
| **Pattern B: Layer-by-Layer** | Split by architectural layer | Use with caution - Ensure WO-001 creates bootable base |

**Work Order Sizing Guidelines:**

| Size | Lines of Code | Components | Duration | Example |
|------|---------------|------------|----------|---------|
| Small | < 100 LOC | 1-2 files | 2-4 hours | Add computed field to existing model |
| Medium | 100-300 LOC | 3-5 files | 4-8 hours | Create model + security + basic views |
| Large | 300-500 LOC | 6-10 files | 8-12 hours | Complete vertical slice with workflow |
| Too Large | > 500 LOC | > 10 files | > 12 hours | ❌ SPLIT THIS |

**Decomposition Decision Tree:**
- Guides Scrum Master through analyzing `Story.yaml`
- Checks: Is this a new module? Can it be split into vertical slices?
- Ensures each WO includes minimum bootable components

**Common Mistakes Section:**
- ❌ Model without security (Odoo install fails)
- ❌ Views depending on unmerged model (agent can't test)
- ❌ Too many features in one WO (>500 LOC)

**Testing Bootability Checklist:**
1. Can an agent install this module in Odoo?
2. Can an agent test this code in a running Odoo instance?
3. Does this depend on uncommitted code from another WO?
4. Is this > 500 lines of code?

### **2. Coder Agent Primer Rewritten**

**File:** `prompts/onboarding_coder_agent.md`

**Version:** 3.0 - Isolated Environments

**Major Changes:**

#### **Section 3: Pre-Work Verification (NEW - MANDATORY)**

5-step checklist BEFORE starting any work order:

1. **Identify Your Repository:** Check work order for `hub` or `evv`
2. **Navigate & Verify:** `git remote -v` to confirm correct repo
3. **Start YOUR Isolated Test Environment:** `./scripts/start-agent-env.sh WO-XXX`
4. **Create Feature Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/WO-XXX-brief-description`
5. **Verify Your Context:** Checklist confirms all 5 steps complete

#### **Isolated Environment Integration**

**Before (Shared Environment):**
```bash
docker-compose up -d  # All agents share this - risk of interference
```

**After (Isolated):**
```bash
./scripts/start-agent-env.sh WO-042
# Agent gets:
# - Container: odoo_hub_WO-042
# - Access URL: http://localhost:8090 (auto-assigned)
# - Database: postgres_WO-042
```

#### **Updated Proof of Execution**

All test/boot/upgrade logs now generated in agent's isolated environment:

```bash
docker exec odoo_hub_WO-042 odoo -c /etc/odoo/odoo.conf \
    --test-enable --stop-after-init --log-level=test \
    -d postgres_WO-042 -i your_module > proof_of_execution_tests.log 2>&1
```

#### **Consolidated Architecture References**

Integrated key points from:
- ADR-003 (API-First Design)
- ADR-006 (Tenancy-Aware Code)
- ADR-007 (Modular Independence)
- ADR-013 (Repository Boundaries)
- ADR-014 (Parallel Agent Coordination)
- ADR-015 (Test Environment Isolation)

**Result:** Agent reads ONE primer and gets all critical information.

#### **Quick Reference Card (Section 12)**

"Your First 5 Minutes" and "Before You Say I'm Done" checklists with exact commands.

#### **Cleanup Section**

```bash
./scripts/stop-agent-env.sh WO-042 --cleanup
```

Removes container, database, volumes when work order complete.

### **3. Dispatch Brief Template (NEW)**

**File:** `templates/dispatch_brief_template.md`

**Purpose:** Single-document pattern for assigning agents tasks

**Structure:**
1. Role Context (references primer)
2. Task Details (objective, scope, context)
3. Development Environment (isolated env setup for coders)
4. Acceptance Criteria (specific, measurable)
5. Required Context Documents (links)
6. Technical Specifications (models, fields, rules)
7. Completion Workflow (step-by-step)
8. Common Pitfalls (task-specific warnings)
9. Questions & Clarifications (pre-flight checklist)
10. Success Criteria
11. Timeline & Milestones
12. Need Help? (escalation path)

**Human Overseer Checklist:**
- Ensures all placeholders filled before dispatch
- Validates scope (IN/OUT) explicitly defined
- Confirms environment details correct

**Your Benefit:** Fill template once, agent gets complete brief - you don't remember multiple files.

---

### **4. Redundant Checklist Removed**

**Deleted:** `prompts/AGENT_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`

**Reason:** Content consolidated into role-specific primers

**Before:** 
- Primer (role + architecture) + Checklist (verification) + Ring 0 + ADRs = **TOO MANY FILES**

**After:**
- **ONE Primer per role** = Role + Architecture + Verification + References to Ring 0/ADRs

---

### **5. ADR-015 Status Updated**

**File:** `decisions/015-test-environment-isolation-for-parallel-agents.md`

**Changed:**
- Status: `Proposed (Future)` → `Approved for Implementation`
- Implementation Target: Phase 1 complete by end of sprint

**Updated Rationale:**
- Lessons from Entry #009: Reactive fixes are costly - better to prevent
- Accidental parallel work risk: Infrastructure needed NOW
- Future-proof: When same-repo parallel work increases, infrastructure ready

---

### **6. Implementation Plan Created**

**File:** `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AGENT_TEST_ISOLATION.md`

**Detailed plan for isolated test environments:**

**Architecture:** Work Order Scoped Containers
- Each WO gets: Own container, own database, own volumes, own port
- Example: WO-042 → `odoo_hub_wo042`, `postgres_wo042`, port 8090

**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Ready to Implement)**
- Create `docker-compose.agent.yml` (Hub and EVV)
- Create `scripts/start-agent-env.sh` (start isolated env, auto-assign port)
- Create `scripts/stop-agent-env.sh` (stop and cleanup)
- Create `scripts/list-agent-envs.sh` (show all running envs)

**Timeline:** ~2 hours for Phase 1

**Success Criteria:**
- Two agents can run isolated environments simultaneously (same repo)
- No port conflicts
- Clean startup (<30 seconds)
- Volumes preserved between stops (unless --cleanup)

## 🚀 **What You Can Do Now**

### **Simplified Agent Dispatch**

**For Coder Agents:**
```markdown
@agent

Please read your primer: @aos-architecture/prompts/onboarding_coder_agent.md

Then complete this work order: [GitHub Issue URL or inline details]
```

That's it! One primer has everything.

**For Scrum Master Agents:**
```markdown
@agent

Please read your primer: @aos-architecture/prompts/onboarding_scrum_master.md

Then decompose this Story.yaml: @aos-architecture/specs/evv/AGMT-002.yaml
```

**Optional: Use Dispatch Brief Template for complex tasks**
- Fill in `templates/dispatch_brief_template.md`
- Gives agent a single, complete brief

---

## 🎯 **Impact on Your Three Concerns**

### **1. Work Order Bootability ✅ SOLVED**

**Before:** Scrum Master could create WO-001: "Create service.agreement model" (no security) → Odoo install fails

**After:** Scrum Master follows Section 3.1 decomposition patterns:
- Pattern A (Vertical Slice): WO-001 includes model + security + basic views → Bootable
- Security CSV Rule enforced: "If model created, MUST include security"
- Bootability checklist: "Can agent install this module in Odoo?"

**Result:** Every work order produces code that boots Odoo.

---

### **2. Onboarding Simplification ✅ SOLVED**

**Before:** You had to remember:
- `onboarding_coder_agent.md`
- `AGENT_ONBOARDING_CHECKLIST.md`
- `prompts/core/00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`
- ADR-013, ADR-014, ADR-015
- Work Order Template

**After:** You give agent:
- `onboarding_coder_agent.md` ← **ONE FILE**

That primer includes:
- Role definition
- Architecture principles (ADR-003, 006, 007, 013, 014, 015 summarized)
- Pre-work verification (5-step checklist)
- Testing requirements
- Proof of execution
- Quick reference
- References to Ring 0 and full ADRs (for deep dives when needed)

**Result:** ONE entry point per agent role.

---

### **3. Parallel Work Infrastructure ✅ PLANNED (Ready to Implement)**

**Before:** No isolated environments → Risk of accidental parallel work causing collisions

**After:** 
- ADR-015 status changed to "Approved for Implementation"
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_AGENT_TEST_ISOLATION.md` created with detailed plan
- Phase 1 scripts defined (start-agent-env.sh, stop-agent-env.sh, list-agent-envs.sh)
- Coder primer updated to reference isolated environments

**Next Step:** Implement Phase 1 (~2 hours) to create the scripts

**Result:** Infrastructure ready BEFORE parallel work becomes common (proactive, not reactive).

---

## 📝 **What You Need to Do**

### **Immediate:**

1. **Commit Ring 0 Update (Manual):**
   ```bash
   cd aos-architecture/
   git add prompts/core/00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md
   git commit -m "docs: Update Ring 0 with repository boundaries (manual commit - Ring 0 protected)"
   git push
   ```

2. **Review the Changes:**
   - Scrum Master primer: Section 3.1 (Odoo decomposition patterns)
   - Coder Agent primer: Complete rewrite (v3.0)
   - Dispatch Brief template: New file

3. **Test Simplified Dispatch:**
   - Next time you dispatch an agent, give them ONLY their primer
   - See if they follow the pre-work verification checklist
   - Evaluate if they have everything they need

### **Next Session (Optional):**

4. **Implement Phase 1 of Isolated Environments:**
   - Create `hub/scripts/start-agent-env.sh`
   - Create `hub/scripts/stop-agent-env.sh`
   - Create `hub/scripts/list-agent-envs.sh`
   - Replicate for `evv/`
   - Test: Start two isolated environments in same repo

### **Future:**

5. **Update Other Role Primers:**
   - Apply same consolidation pattern to Architect primer, etc.
   - Ensure all role primers are self-contained entry points

---

## 🎓 **Key Takeaways**

1. **Bootability is Non-Negotiable:** Scrum Master now has Odoo-specific guidance to ensure every WO produces bootable code.

2. **One Primer per Role:** Simplified onboarding - you give agent ONE document, they get everything they need.

3. **Proactive Infrastructure:** Isolated test environments planned and approved BEFORE parallel work becomes common (learning from Entry #009).

4. **Dispatch Brief Template:** Optional tool for complex tasks - consolidates role + task in single document.

5. **Architecture Enforcement:** Pre-commit hooks + primers + Ring 0 = Multi-layered protection against architectural drift.
