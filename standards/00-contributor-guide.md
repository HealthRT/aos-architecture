# 0. A Guide to Our Development Process

### Our Goal
Welcome! This project is building the **Agency Operating System (AOS)**, a modern platform to manage our Hub (HR, Admin) and EVV (Patient Care, Scheduling) operations. Our goal is to build this system through a clear, collaborative, and agile process.

### Your Role is Crucial
Whether you are a Subject Matter Expert (SME), a manager, or a team member, your real-world expertise is the most critical ingredient for success. This guide explains how we gather your feedback and ideas to ensure we are always building the right thing.

## How We Ask for Your Feedback (The "SME Review")

From time to time, we will need your expert opinion on a new feature, workflow, or business rule. We do this using a process called an "SME Review."

#### 1. What is an "Issue"?
An "Issue" is simply a dedicated webpage on our GitHub project site for discussing a specific topic. Think of it as a focused conversation thread. You don't need to know anything about GitHub to use it.

#### 2. What Do I Need to Do?
You will receive a direct link to the Issue. When you click it, you will see a page with two main parts:
- **The Proposal:** A clear description of the feature or rule we need your feedback on.
- **A Checklist:** A few simple questions to guide your feedback.

All you need to do is **read the proposal, check the boxes that apply, and leave any additional thoughts in the comment box** at the bottom of the page. You can even just reply to the email notification you receive, and your reply will be posted as a comment automatically.

#### 3. What Happens to My Feedback?
This is the most important part. Our Executive Architect (an AI) is responsible for processing your feedback. The Architect will read your comments, update our official plans and user stories, and then post a final comment on the Issue confirming what action was taken. This ensures your feedback is never lost and is directly integrated into the project.

## How We Capture New Ideas (The "Idea Backlog")

You will undoubtedly have great ideas for new features or improvements. We want to capture all of them without losing focus on our current priorities (the "MVP").

#### How it Works
1.  **Share Your Idea:** The best way to share a new idea is to mention it in a comment on a related SME Review issue, or through your normal communication channels.
2.  **The Architect Captures It:** The Architect will create a special `[IDEA]` ticket for your concept and place it in a dedicated "Idea Backlog" on our project board.
3.  **We Revisit It Later:** This creates a "parking lot" of valuable ideas. It ensures your idea is never forgotten and can be reviewed and prioritized when we plan our next phase of development after the MVP is complete.

Thank you for your contribution. Your expertise is what makes this project possible.
