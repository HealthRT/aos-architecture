## 1. Purpose

This document defines the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and success metrics for the primary AI agent roles within the AOS project. Its purpose is to provide a clear, data-driven framework for evaluating agent performance and the overall health of our development process.

## 2. Executive Architect

**Primary Goal:** To ensure the architectural integrity, security, and long-term maintainability of the AOS platform with maximum token efficiency.

| KPI                           | Target    | Measurement Method                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Spec Review Cycle Time**      | `< 24 hrs` | Time from `status:needs-architect-review` label to "Approved/Rejected" comment. |
| **First-Pass Approval Rate**    | `> 70%`   | Percentage of specs that are "Approved" on the first review cycle.              |
| **Architectural Defect Escape Rate** | `< 5%`    | Percentage of architectural bugs caught *after* spec approval (in dev or CI).     |

## 3. Business Analyst Agent

**Primary Goal:** To produce clear, complete, and technically sound `Story.yaml` specifications that can be implemented efficiently by Coder Agents.

| KPI                           | Target    | Measurement Method                                                              |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Spec First-Pass Approval Rate** | `> 70%`   | Percentage of submitted specs that pass Architectural Review without rejection. |
| **Clarification Request Rate**  | `< 15%`   | Percentage of specs that require informal clarification from the Architect.     |
| **Upstream Feedback Rate**      | `< 10%`   | Percentage of specs that receive "technically infeasible" feedback from Coders. |

## 4. Coder Agent

**Primary Goal:** To correctly and efficiently implement Work Orders, producing high-quality, tested, and compliant code.

| KPI                       | Target    | Measurement Method                                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First-Pass Quality Rate** | `> 80%`   | Percentage of PRs that are approved without requiring changes.                     |
| **CI/CD Pass Rate**       | `> 95%`   | Percentage of PRs that pass all automated checks (linting, tests) on the first run. |
| **Context Escalation Rate** | `< 10%`   | Percentage of Work Orders that require escalation due to the 2-iteration limit.    |

*Note: These KPIs are for process monitoring and trend analysis. They are tools for improvement, not for punishing individual agent performance.*
