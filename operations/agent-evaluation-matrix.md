2. ‚úÖ Comprehensive feedback entry with actionable suggestions
3. ‚úÖ Self-assessed accurately (gave 9/10, matches architectural review)
4. ‚úÖ Provided context for evaluation (acknowledged being tested)

**Strengths:**
- Perfect instruction following (100% checklist completion)
- Exceptional documentation quality (comprehensive, well-organized)
- Strong autonomous execution (no hand-holding required)
- Thoughtful feedback (4 concrete suggestions for improvement)

**Weaknesses:**
- Slightly slower than GPT-5 (60 min vs 45 min for comparable work)
- Minor: Needed brief investigation of docker architecture (resolved independently)

**Comparison to GPT-5:**
- **Instruction Fidelity:** Claude 100% vs GPT-5 50% (‚≠ê Claude wins decisively)
- **Context Efficiency:** Claude 6% vs GPT-5 70% (‚≠ê Claude wins)

### GPT-4 Codex (OpenAI)

#### [Future Evaluation]
**Date:** [Pending]  
**Task:** [To be assigned]

**Results:** [TBD]

## Findings & Recommendations

### Current Status (Updated 2025-10-12)
- **2 agents evaluated:** GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Clear Winner Emerging:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 significantly outperforms on instruction fidelity
- **Key Finding:** Context management highly correlated with instruction following

### Initial Conclusions

#### 1. Instruction Fidelity & Context Management
**Finding:** Claude's superior context efficiency (6% vs 70%) directly correlates with perfect instruction following.

**Hypothesis Confirmed:** Instruction fidelity DOES degrade with context pressure
- GPT-5 at 40% context: Missed test imports
- GPT-5 at 70% context: Forgot feedback entry
- Claude at 6% context: Perfect execution (100%)

**Implication:** For multi-step work orders, Claude's larger effective context window (200K vs GPT-5's ~128K) provides significant reliability advantage.

#### 2. Documentation vs. Code Quality
**Status:** Need more data
- Both agents produced excellent output quality
- GPT-5 tested on code + tests (complex)
- Claude tested on documentation (different skill set)
- **Next:** Need to test Claude on coding work order for fair comparison

#### 3. Speed vs. Reliability Trade-off
**Finding:** GPT-5 is 25% faster but requires supervision
- GPT-5: 45 min + 2 reminders + architect review time
- Claude: 60 min + zero supervision = faster end-to-end
- **Winner:** Claude (true speed includes supervision overhead)

### Proposed Actions (Updated)
1. ‚úÖ Evaluate Claude Sonnet 4.5 on WO-05 (COMPLETE)
2. ‚úÖ Update agent evaluation matrix (COMPLETE)
3. üéØ **RECOMMENDED:** Assign Claude next coding work order (WO-06 or next feature)
4. ‚è≥ Evaluate GPT-4 Codex only if Claude fails coding test
5. ‚è≥ Finalize "Agent Selection Guide"

### Questions Answered
- ‚úÖ **Does instruction fidelity correlate with context size?** YES - Strong correlation
- ‚úÖ **Which agent is most reliable for multi-step tasks?** Claude (100% vs 50%)
- ‚è≥ **Which agent produces best code quality?** Need coding comparison
- ‚è≥ **Which agent has best test coverage?** Need coding comparison
- ‚è≥ **Cost/performance trade-offs?** Need to compare pricing

## Agent Selection Guide (Preliminary)

**Status:** Preliminary recommendations based on 2 agents evaluated. Will be finalized after Claude completes coding work order.

### Recommended Agent by Task Type:

| Task Type | Recommended Agent | Confidence | Rationale |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-----------|
| **Documentation** | ‚≠ê **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | High | Proven: 1,070-line comprehensive doc, perfect execution |
| **Multi-Step Workflows** | ‚≠ê **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | High | 100% checklist completion vs GPT-5's 50% |
| **Bootstrap/Scaffolding** | ü§î TBD | Low | Need Claude coding test |
| **Complex Business Logic** | ü§î TBD | Low | Need Claude coding test |
| **Testing Work Orders** | ü§î TBD | Low | Need Claude coding test |
| **Refactoring** | ü§î TBD | Low | Need Claude coding test |
| **Speed-Critical Tasks** | GPT-5 (with supervision) | Medium | 25% faster but needs reminders |

### Preliminary Default Agent:
**‚≠ê Claude Sonnet 4.5**

**Reasoning:**
1. **Reliability:** 100% instruction fidelity vs 50% for GPT-5
2. **Autonomy:** Zero reminders vs 2 reminders for GPT-5
3. **Context:** 6% usage vs 70% (more headroom for complex tasks)
4. **Quality:** Excellent output (matches GPT-5)
5. **True Speed:** No supervision overhead

**Caveat:** This recommendation is based on one documentation task. Must be validated with coding work order before finalizing.
