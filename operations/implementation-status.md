- ‚úÖ `service.agreement` model (28 fields, complete schema)
- ‚úÖ Computed fields (start_date, end_date, total_amount)
- ‚úÖ Validation constraints (date range, positive units)
- ‚úÖ State methods (action_activate, action_cancel)
- ‚úÖ Security model (access control rules)

**Repository:** `HealthRT/evv`  
**Branch:** Merged from `feature/WO-AGMT-001-01-service-agreement-model` and `feature/WO-AGMT-001-05-service-agreement-docs`  
**Commits:** 5 commits (bootstrap, tests fix, proof logs, docs, docs proof)

## üìä Process Improvements Implemented

### Testing Requirements Hardening
**Based on:** Process Improvement Entries #005, #007  
**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated Scrum Master primer with mandatory testing section
- ‚úÖ Updated Work Order Template with testing verification checklist
- ‚úÖ Updated Coder Agent primer (v2.1 Lean) with test verification
- ‚úÖ Created `validate-work-order.sh` script for automated checks
- ‚úÖ Added "CRITICAL: Verify Your Tests Actually Ran" section to primer

### Agent Evaluation Framework
**Status:** Active evaluation in progress  
**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Created agent evaluation matrix
- ‚úÖ Evaluated GPT-5 (score: 68/100)
- ‚úÖ Evaluated Claude Sonnet 4.5 on documentation (score: 95/100)
- ‚è≥ Next: Evaluate Claude on coding work order

**Key Finding:** Instruction fidelity correlates with agent architecture, not just context size. Claude significantly outperforms on multi-step tasks.

### Documentation Architecture
**Status:** Established and populated  
**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Created `docs/reference/` hierarchy
- ‚úÖ Saved Service Agreement sample to `features/evv/service-agreement-management/reference/samples/`
- ‚úÖ Created `REFERENCES.md` for feature-specific document links
- ‚úÖ Created guides for SME question tracking (Open Items process)

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate: Test Claude on Coding (Recommended)

**Purpose:** Validate Claude's coding ability before making default assignment

**Options:**

**Option A: Next Natural Feature (Recommended)**
- Wait for Scrum Master to decompose next EVV story
- Assign first work order to Claude
- Full production workload test

**Option B: Small Coding Task**
- Create lightweight work order (e.g., add computed field, add view enhancement)
- Quick test of coding + testing ability
- Lower stakes

**Option C: Hub Feature (Parallel Development)**
- Assign Claude first work order of Hub Traction EOS refactoring
- Different codebase, different domain
- Validates cross-domain capability

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - Next natural EVV feature work order to Claude

---

### Medium-Term: Continue EVV Development

**Candidates for Next Story (from feature brief):**
1. Service Agreement Lookup/Search enhancement
2. Service Agreement state management (auto-expiration)
3. Basic validation rules implementation
4. Integration with external county systems (SFTP import)

**Status:** Awaiting story selection and decomposition

---

### Long-Term: Hub Development

**Ready for Development:**
- Traction EOS Module Refactoring
- Analysis report exists: `review/Traction_EOS_Module_Analysis_Report.md`
- Hub Architect primer created
- Can start in parallel with EVV

**Status:** Ready when prioritized

---

## üìã Open Items

### EVV Domain
- ‚è≥ SME review of AGMT-001 Open Items (6 questions)
- ‚è≥ Next story selection and decomposition
- ‚è≥ UI/UX mockups for complex flows (future)

### Process
- ‚è≥ Finalize agent evaluation (test Claude on coding)
- ‚è≥ Complete Agent Selection Guide
- ‚è≥ Document fresh context per task workflow

### Technical Debt
- ‚è≥ Trim documentation to optimal length (~800 lines)
- ‚è≥ Create custom "Designated Coordinator" security group (currently using admin)
- ‚è≥ Implement field-level PHI security
- ‚è≥ Add record rules for multi-tenancy

## ü§ñ Agent Assignments

### Current Agents
- **GPT-5 (OpenAI):** Completed WO-01 to WO-04 (68/100 score, requires supervision)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Anthropic):** Completed WO-05 (95/100 score, perfect execution)

### Default Agent Selection
**Status:** Pending coding evaluation  
**Current Recommendation:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (after coding test passes)

### Agent Capabilities
| Task Type | Recommended Agent | Confidence |
|-----------|------------------|------------|
| Documentation | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | High ‚úÖ |
| Multi-Step Workflows | Claude Sonnet 4.5 | High ‚úÖ |
| Speed-Critical Simple Tasks | GPT-5 (with supervision) | Medium |
| Coding (Bootstrap/Logic/Tests) | TBD | Pending evaluation |

## üìä Metrics

### Velocity
- **Sprint 1 (AGMT-001):** 5 work orders completed in 2 days
- **Agent Performance:** Claude 100% instruction fidelity, GPT-5 50%
- **Quality Gates:** All passing (architectural review, proof of execution, testing)

### Code Quality
- ‚úÖ 8 unit tests, 0 failures
- ‚úÖ 28 model fields, 100% specification compliance
- ‚úÖ Clean boot logs (no errors)
- ‚úÖ Successful module upgrades
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

### Process Quality
- ‚úÖ Zero production bugs (pre-production)
- ‚úÖ Testing verification caught 1 critical issue (empty tests/__init__.py)
- ‚úÖ Work order validation caught "tests optional" issue pre-dispatch
- ‚úÖ Feedback loop working (3 process improvement entries logged)

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What's Working
1. ‚úÖ Single source of truth (aos-architecture) prevents confusion
2. ‚úÖ Work order decomposition enables parallel work and quality gates
3. ‚úÖ Mandatory proof of execution catches issues before merge
4. ‚úÖ Process improvement loop enables continuous refinement
5. ‚úÖ Consolidated dispatch briefs improve agent success rates

### What Needs Improvement
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Agent instruction fidelity varies significantly (need better agent selection)
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Work order validation should be automated (validate-work-order.sh exists but not enforced)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è SME question tracking process needs refinement (awaiting feedback)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Context management strategy needs documentation (fresh context per task recommended)
