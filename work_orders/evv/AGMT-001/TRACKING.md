## 📊 **Agent Performance**

| Agent | Work Orders | Instruction Fidelity | Code Quality | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| GPT-5 | WO-01 to WO-04 | 50% (2 reminders) | Excellent | Fast but requires supervision |
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | WO-05 | 100% (0 reminders) | Excellent | Perfect execution, autonomous |

**Recommendation:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 for future work orders (pending coding test)

## 📞 **Escalation Path**

If any work order fails after 2 attempts:
1. Agent escalates to human overseer
2. Review failure mode
3. Decide: Rework work order, provide guidance, or pivot approach
4. Update Process Improvement Log if systemic issue identified
