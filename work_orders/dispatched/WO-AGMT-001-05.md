# Work Order: WO-AGMT-001-05 – Author Documentation for Service Agreements

## 1. Context & Objective

Document the `service.agreement` model behaviors and usage in `docs/models/service_agreement.md`, ensuring clarity for future maintainers and auditors.

---

## 2. Repository Setup

**Repository:** evv  
**Base Branch:** feature/WO-AGMT-001-04-service-agreement-tests  
**New Branch:** feature/WO-AGMT-001-05-service-agreement-docs

**Setup Commands:**
```bash
git checkout feature/WO-AGMT-001-04-service-agreement-tests
git checkout -b feature/WO-AGMT-001-05-service-agreement-docs
```

---

## 3. Problem Statement & Technical Details

### `evv/addons/evv_agreements/docs/models/service_agreement.md`
Create documentation file outlining model purpose, field definitions, state machine, and integration points (future Service Validation Engine).

### `evv/addons/evv_agreements/__manifest__.py`
Update `description` or documentation references if needed to point to the new doc location.

---

## 4. Required Implementation

### Documentation Content
- Overview referencing Story `AGMT-001` and module intent.
- Table or structured list describing each field, type, required flag, default, and business meaning.
- State machine narrative for `draft → active → cancelled/expired` with future `expired` automation noted.
- Business rules: date ordering, positive units, activation validations.
- Security section: only Designated Coordinator group manages agreements; note PHI handling.
- Integration hooks: placeholders for Service Validation Engine, override process, reporting feeds.
- Pointer to automated tests and how to execute them.

### Compliance Considerations
- Avoid PHI examples; use generic placeholders.
- Highlight HIPAA alignment and audit logging expectations.

### Formatting
- Follow project markdown conventions (headings, bullet styles).
- Include future scope under clearly labeled section (no TODOs).

---

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation file created with comprehensive content covering schema, lifecycle, validation rules, security, and future integrations.
- [ ] References Story `AGMT-001` and links to relevant specs/tests.
- [ ] Markdown linting passes (if pipeline enforced).
- [ ] Code committed with descriptive message.
- [ ] Odoo boots without errors (MANDATORY) – confirm module still installs post-doc update.
- [ ] Proof of execution logs captured (boot command).

---

## 6. Context Management & Iteration Limits

Standard workflow applies.

---

## 7. Required Context Documents

- `@aos-architecture/specs/evv/AGMT-001.yaml`
- `@aos-architecture/features/evv/service-agreement-management/service-agreement-management.feature-brief.md`
- `@aos-architecture/standards/00-contributor-guide.md`

---

## 7. Technical Constraints

- Markdown must remain ASCII; follow existing documentation patterns.

---

## 8. Proof of Execution

Provide boot logs confirming module loads cleanly (no code changes expected but still required by process).
