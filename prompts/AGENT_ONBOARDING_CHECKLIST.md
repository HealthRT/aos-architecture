# Agent Onboarding Checklist - Hardened Architecture

**Version:** 2.0 (Post-ADR-013/014/015)  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-12  
**Purpose:** Ensure all agents (current and future) understand the hardened architectural decisions

---

## üéØ **Mandatory Reading for All Agents**

Every agent MUST read these documents before receiving work orders:

### **Ring 0: The Immutable Core (Non-Negotiable)**

**File:** `prompts/core/00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`

**Key Principles:**
- [ ] **Human Final Authority:** Only humans merge PRs, only humans modify Ring 0
- [ ] **No PHI Leakage:** Protected Health Information never in logs, commits, issues
- [ ] **Federated Architecture:** Hub and EVV are separate instances, API-only communication
- [ ] **Repository Boundaries:** Hub modules in Hub repo, EVV modules in EVV repo (ADR-013)
- [ ] **Hard Multi-Tenancy:** No hardcoded company values (ADR-006)

**Test Your Understanding:**
- Q: Can I commit an `evv_*` module to the Hub repository?
- A: NO - Pre-commit hook will reject it (ADR-013)

---

### **Ring 1: Protected Layer (Standards & ADRs)**

#### **Critical ADRs (Must Read)**

     - Q: What command verifies correct repository? (Answer: `git remote -v`)
     - Q: What happens if I commit Hub module to EVV? (Answer: Pre-commit hook rejects)

6. **‚≠ê ADR-014: Parallel Agent Coordination (NEW - CRITICAL)**
   - File: `decisions/014-parallel-agent-coordination-patterns.md`

     - Q: Safest parallel pattern? (Answer: Pattern 1 - Module Isolation)
     - Q: What file tracks active work? (Answer: `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` in each repo)

7. **ADR-015: Test Environment Isolation (NEW - PROPOSED)**
   - File: `decisions/015-test-environment-isolation-for-parallel-agents.md`
   - Key: Deferred - use Pattern 1 (Module Isolation) for now
   - Test: Do I have my own Odoo instance? (Answer: Not yet - share with repo)

## üîç **Repository-Specific Onboarding**

### **Before Working in Hub Repository**

**Read:** `/path/to/hub/README.md`

- [ ] Understand Hub's purpose (Admin, HR, compliance, Traction)
- [ ] Know allowed module prefixes: `hub_*`, `traction*`
- [ ] Understand Docker setup: `cd hub/ && docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Know access URL: `http://localhost:8090`
- [ ] Locate `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` for file lock coordination

### **Before Working in EVV Repository**

**Read:** `/path/to/evv/README.md`

- [ ] Understand EVV's purpose (HIPAA care delivery, visits, billing)
- [ ] Know allowed module prefix: `evv_*`
- [ ] Understand HIPAA compliance requirements
- [ ] Understand Docker setup: `cd evv/ && docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Know access URL: `http://localhost:8091`
- [ ] Locate `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md` for file lock coordination

---

## ‚úÖ **Pre-Work Verification (Every Work Order)**

**Before starting ANY work order, you MUST:**

### Step 1: Repository Verification
```bash
cd /path/to/[target-repo]/
git remote -v
# Output MUST show: HealthRT/[hub|evv].git
```

### Step 2: Docker Environment Check
```bash
ls docker-compose.yml
# Must exist in repository root
```

### Step 3: Module Prefix Validation
- Hub work ‚Üí Module must be `hub_*` or `traction*`
- EVV work ‚Üí Module must be `evv_*`

### Step 4: File Lock Check
```bash
cat WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md
# Check if any files you plan to modify are locked by another agent
```

### Step 5: README Review
```bash
cat README.md | less
# Understand repo-specific guidelines
```

## üéì **Knowledge Checks**

**Every agent must be able to answer these correctly:**

### Architecture Questions

1. **Q:** Are Hub and EVV in the same database?  
   **A:** NO - Separate Odoo instances, API-only communication (ADR-001)

2. **Q:** Can I access Hub database from EVV code?  
   **A:** NO - API-only, no direct DB access (Ring 0)

3. **Q:** Where do I put a module for visit tracking?  
   **A:** EVV repository, name it `evv_visits` (ADR-013)

4. **Q:** I'm working on `hub_compliance`. Which Docker environment?  
   **A:** Hub: `cd hub/ && docker-compose up -d`, access on port 8090

### Process Questions

5. **Q:** Can I skip writing tests for my module?  
   **A:** NO - Tests MANDATORY for all code changes (Standard 08, Ring 0)

6. **Q:** Another agent is modifying `models/service_agreement.py`. Can I work on it too?  
   **A:** NO - Check `WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md`, coordinate or wait (ADR-014)

7. **Q:** My PR is approved. Can I merge it?  
   **A:** NO - Only humans merge PRs (Ring 0)

8. **Q:** I found a gap in the Coder Agent primer. What do I do?  
   **A:** Write feedback to Ring 2 (`process_improvement/process-improvement.md`)

### Safety Questions

9. **Q:** I need to commit an `evv_agreements` module to Hub repo for testing. Is that okay?  
   **A:** NO - Pre-commit hook will reject it. Test in EVV repo. (ADR-013)

10. **Q:** Can I hardcode `company_id = 1` in my code?  
   **A:** NO - Hard multi-tenancy violation (ADR-006, Ring 0)

### Emergency Questions

11. **Q:** I've tried fixing a bug twice and it still fails. What now?  
   **A:** STOP. Escalate with `status:needs-help` label. (2-iteration limit)

12. **Q:** The work order is unclear about which repository to use. What do I do?  
   **A:** STOP. Ask for clarification. Don't guess. (ADR-013)

## üìö **Agent-Specific Primers**

### For Coder Agents
**Primary Primer:** `prompts/onboarding_coder_agent.md`  
**Key Updates:** Section 2.1 (Repository & Docker), Section 5 (Proof of Execution)

### For Scrum Master Agents
**Primary Primer:** `prompts/onboarding_scrum_master.md`  
**Critical:** Work orders MUST include Development Environment section (Section 2)

### For Architect Agents
**Primary Primer:** `prompts/onboarding_architect_hub.md`  
**Focus:** Ring 1 changes require human approval (ADR-009)

## üöÄ **First Work Order Workflow**

**For an agent's FIRST work order:**

1. **Complete this checklist** ‚úÖ (You are here)
2. **Read Ring 0:** `prompts/core/00_NON_NEGOTIABLES.md`
3. **Read ADR-013, ADR-014:** Repository boundaries and coordination
4. **Read target repo README:** Hub or EVV specific
5. **Read your role primer:** Coder, Scrum Master, etc.
6. **Run Pre-Work Verification** (see above)
